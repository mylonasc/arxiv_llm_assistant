<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10971v1>What Exactly Does Guidance Do in Masked Discrete Diffusion Models (2506.10971v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the use of classifier-free guidance (CFG) in masked discrete diffusion models and its impact on sampling behavior. The authors derive an explicit solution for the guided reverse dynamics and show that guidance can amplify class-specific regions while suppressing shared regions, leading to distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution. The findings highlight the potential for guidance to not only shape the output distribution, but also control the dynamics of the sampling trajectory, with implications for convergence.</p>

The paper presents a new attack, called the lattice climber attack, for randomized mixtures of classifiers. It discusses the limitations of existing attacks and introduces two desirable properties for effective attacks. The new attack is shown to meet these properties and has theoretical guarantees in the binary linear setting.

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10982v1>Rethinking Losses for Diffusion Bridge Samplers (2506.10982v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential benefits of using the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss instead of the Log Variance (LV) loss in diffusion bridge samplers, a type of deep-learning method for sampling from unnormalized distributions. The authors argue that the rKL loss, when combined with the log-derivative trick, consistently outperforms the LV loss and avoids conceptual problems. Experimental results show that samplers trained with the rKL loss achieve better performance and require less hyperparameter optimization. This has the potential to significantly impact the use of diffusion bridge samplers in academic research.</p>
