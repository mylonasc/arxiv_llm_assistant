<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16893v1>Statistical Test for Saliency Maps of Graph Neural Networks via Selective Inference (2505.16893v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a statistical testing framework for evaluating the reliability of saliency maps in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By addressing the issue of inflated Type I error rates, the proposed method provides statistically valid results and ensures that identified salient subgraphs contain meaningful information. This has the potential to greatly improve the interpretation and reliability of GNN decisions in various domains, making a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16959v1>Bigger Isn't Always Memorizing: Early Stopping Overparameterized Diffusion Models (2505.16959v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the mechanisms underlying generalization in diffusion probabilistic models, which are widely used in modern generative AI. The authors show that, in highly overparameterized models, generalization is achieved during training before the onset of memorization. This has implications for hyperparameter transfer and privacy-sensitive applications, and suggests that a principled early-stopping criterion can optimize generalization while avoiding memorization.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16965v1>BP-Seg: A graphical model approach to unsupervised and non-contiguous text segmentation using belief propagation (2505.16965v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
BP-Seg is a new unsupervised learning approach for text segmentation that considers both local coherence and semantic similarity. By using belief propagation on graphical models, it effectively groups distant yet related sentences. This technique has the potential to greatly improve text segmentation in academic research, leading to more accurate and efficient downstream applications.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16937v1>Quasi-optimal hierarchically semi-separable matrix approximation (2505.16937v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a randomized algorithm for producing a quasi-optimal hierarchically semi-separable (HSS) approximation to a matrix using only matrix-vector products. The algorithm has the potential to significantly reduce the runtime and approximation error compared to existing methods. This could have a lasting impact on academic research by providing a more efficient and accurate approach to HSS matrix approximation.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17000v1>Critical Points of Random Neural Networks (2505.17000v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the expected number of critical points in random neural networks as the depth increases. The authors derive precise formulas and identify three distinct regimes based on the first derivative of the covariance. Numerical experiments support the theoretical predictions and suggest a potential divergence in the number of critical points for certain activation functions. These findings have the potential to significantly impact academic research in the field of neural networks.</p>

<p>
This paper presents a new unsupervised prompting method for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that is inspired by in-context learning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed method aims to enhance a pre-trained GNN's generalization to a target dataset without updating parameters or using labeled data. Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms existing prompting methods, highlighting its potential to have a lasting impact on GNN research.</p>

This paper presents a model and simulation algorithm for quantifying the evolution of inequality in complex networks of strategic agents, using game theory. The results show potential for shedding light on the complex drivers of inequality and exhibit consistency across different networks. This has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by providing a replicable algorithm and publicly available data for studying the systemic effects of transactions in real-world social networks.</p>
