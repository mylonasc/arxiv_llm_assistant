<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07923v1>Trading Graph Neural Network (2504.07923v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new algorithm, TGNN, that combines traditional simulated method of moments with machine learning techniques to estimate the impact of various features on asset prices in trading networks. This method outperforms existing methods and can be applied to networks with any structure, allowing for heterogeneity among traders and assets. This has the potential to greatly improve prediction accuracy and have a lasting impact on academic research in this field.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07830v1>MOSAIC: Modeling Social AI for Content Dissemination and Regulation in Multi-Agent Simulations (2504.07830v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents MOSAIC, a new social network simulation framework that uses generative language agents to predict user behaviors and analyze deception in online content. By incorporating diverse user personas, the framework allows for large-scale simulations of content dissemination and engagement. The study evaluates different content moderation strategies and finds that they not only reduce misinformation but also increase user engagement. The open-source software encourages further research in AI and social sciences.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07936v1>We Are All Creators: Generative AI, Collective Knowledge, and the Path Towards Human-AI Synergy (2504.07936v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of generative AI, fueled by neural networks, to challenge traditional notions of human uniqueness and creativity. It argues that these systems operate through mathematical pattern synthesis rather than biological understanding, and are based on collective human knowledge scraped from the internet. The paper advocates for a collaborative approach between humans and AI, which could lead to unprecedented innovation and democratization of creative expression. This has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by unlocking new possibilities and addressing complex challenges.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07848v1>Opinion dynamics and the unpredictability of opinion trajectories in an adaptive social network model (2504.07848v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper introduces a dynamic framework for understanding opinion dynamics in social networks, using the normalized Lempel-Ziv complexity. The results show distinct complexity signatures for different types of nodes, highlighting the importance of temporal analysis in uncovering hidden patterns. This approach has the potential to provide novel insights into social adaptation and polarization, making a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07894v1>DiverseFlow: Sample-Efficient Diverse Mode Coverage in Flows (2504.07894v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents DiverseFlow, a training-free approach to improve the diversity of flow models in real-world applications. By using a determinantal point process, DiverseFlow allows for more variations in a learned flow model with fewer samples, making it a sample-efficient method. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by enabling more efficient exploration of diverse modes in flow-based generative models.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07851v1>Independence Is Not an Issue in Neurosymbolic AI (2504.07851v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper argues that the commonly held belief that conditionally independent random variables in neurosymbolic AI models lead to deterministic bias is incorrect. The authors provide evidence to support their claim and suggest that this misconception may be hindering progress in the field. If accepted, this could have a lasting impact on the use and development of neurosymbolic AI techniques in academic research.</p>
