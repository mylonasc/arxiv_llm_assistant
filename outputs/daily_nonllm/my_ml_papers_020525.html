<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21741v1>Asymptotic diameter of preferential attachment model (2504.21741v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a study on the asymptotic diameter of the preferential attachment model, $\operatorname{PA}\!_n^{(m,\delta)}$, with parameters $m \ge 2$ and $\delta > 0$. The authors prove that the diameter of $G_n \sim \operatorname{PA}\!_n^{(m,\delta)}$ is $(1+o(1))\log_\nu n$ with high probability, confirming a conjecture and closing a gap in understanding the asymptotic diameter of preferential attachment graphs. This result has the potential to impact academic research in a broader range of models.</p>
