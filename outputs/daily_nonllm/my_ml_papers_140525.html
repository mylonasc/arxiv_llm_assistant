<p>
The paper presents a game-theoretic framework, the Heterogeneous Data Game, to analyze how multiple machine learning providers compete across diverse data sources. The resulting pure Nash equilibria (PNE) can be non-existent, homogeneous, or heterogeneous, depending on factors such as data-source choice models and dominance of certain data sources.

This paper presents a new approach for mapping neuronal networks in vertebrate brains using a combination of deep nets and Discrete Morse techniques from computational topology. By skeletonizing labeled axon fragments and estimating a volumetric length density, this approach provides a biologically meaningful quantification of regional projections. It also offers noise-robustness and the potential to bridge between single-axon skeletons and tracer injections, making it a valuable tool for studying neural networks in academic research.</p>
