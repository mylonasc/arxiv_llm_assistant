<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04289v1>What Languages are Easy to Language-Model? A Perspective from Learning Probabilistic Regular Languages (2406.04289v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for large language models (LMs) to learn different classes of distributions over strings, specifically focusing on the learnability of regular languages. By evaluating neural LMs on their ability to learn probabilistic regular languages, the authors find that certain complexity parameters and the expected length of sampled strings are strong predictors of learnability.
