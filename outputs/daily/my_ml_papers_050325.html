<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02851v1>Shakespearean Sparks: The Dance of Hallucination and Creativity in LLMs' Decoding Layers (2503.02851v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the relationship between hallucination and creativity in large language models (LLMs) through a quantitative approach. The authors propose a narrow definition of creativity tailored to LLMs and introduce an evaluation framework, HCL, to measure it. Their analysis reveals a tradeoff between hallucination and creativity, with an optimal layer identified in larger models. These findings offer new insights into the interplay between LLM creativity and hallucination and provide a quantitative perspective for future research.</p>
