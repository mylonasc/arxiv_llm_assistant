<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15147v1>S3Eval: A Synthetic, Scalable, Systematic Evaluation Suite for Large Language Models (2310.15147v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents S3Eval, a Synthetic, Scalable, Systematic evaluation suite for Large Language Models (LLMs). S3Eval enables the creation of any number of evaluation examples that are theoretically invisible to LLMs, allowing users to systematically probe LLM capabilities and uncover insights into their performance. The potential for S3Eval to create a lasting impact in academic research of LLMs is demonstrated by its strong correlation with real-world benchmarks.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15051v1>TeleQnA: A Benchmark Dataset to Assess Large Language Models Telecommunications Knowledge (2310.15051v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
TeleQnA is a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) in telecommunications. Results from the evaluation of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 show that LLMs can rival the performance of active professionals in telecom knowledge, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to create a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<p>
BSM is a Large Language Model program that improves evaluation correctness and consistency, reduces length and position biases, and enhances human-LLM agreement. It has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by allowing LLMs to tackle complex natural language tasks and improve the coherence of generated stories.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15109v1>GRENADE: Graph-Centric Language Model for Self-Supervised Representation Learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (2310.15109v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
GRENADE is a novel self-supervised representation learning method for text-attributed graphs, which combines pre-trained language models and graph neural networks to capture both textual semantics and structural context information. It has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by providing more effective and generalizable representations for various downstream tasks.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15047v1>Meta- (out-of-context) learning in neural networks (2310.15047v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
Brown et al. (2020) introduce meta-out-of-context learning (meta-OCL) in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate its potential to "internalize" semantic content from authoritative sources. This could lead to lasting impacts in academic research, as AI systems become more capable of using this knowledge in appropriate circumstances.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15061v1>The BLA Benchmark: Investigating Basic Language Abilities of Pre-Trained Multimodal Models (2310.15061v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents BLA, a benchmark to evaluate the basic language abilities of pre-trained multimodal models. Results show that most models struggle in a zero-shot setting, but the generative BLIP2 shows promising trends. This could lead to lasting impact in academic research, as BLA can be used to evaluate and improve models' basic language abilities.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15007v1>Did the Neurons Read your Book? Document-level Membership Inference for Large Language Models (2310.15007v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a method to infer whether a large language model (LLM) has seen a given document during training. The proposed approach is evaluated on OpenLLaMA-7B and OpenLLaMA-3B, achieving an AUC of 0.856 for books and 0.678 for papers. The results suggest that document-level membership can be accurately inferred for LLMs, increasing transparency and raising important questions about potential bias and copyright issues.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14993v1>Understanding the Inner Workings of Language Models Through Representation Dissimilarity (2310.14993v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a novel approach to understanding the inner workings of language models through representation dissimilarity measures. The results suggest that these measures can provide insight into the mechanics of language models, such as asymmetry in activation functions, generalization properties, and feature variation. This could have a lasting impact in academic research, providing a valuable tool for model trust, interpretability, and transparency.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15141v1>SpecTr: Fast Speculative Decoding via Optimal Transport (2310.15141v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new autoregressive sampling algorithm, SpecTr, which uses optimal transport to speed up sampling from large language models. It provides a $(1-1/e)$-optimal multiplicative draft selection algorithm with almost linear runtime, leading to a 2.13X wall clock speedup over autoregressive sampling. This could have a lasting impact in academic research, allowing for faster and more efficient language model sampling.</p>

<p>
This paper investigates the morphological capabilities of ChatGPT, a large language model, in four languages. Results suggest that ChatGPT underperforms purpose-built systems, particularly in English, and that claims of human-like language skills are premature. This research provides a valuable insight into the potential for LLMs to create a lasting impact in academic research.</p>
