<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17453v1>Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks (2309.17453v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents StreamingLLM, a framework that enables large language models to be deployed in streaming applications with improved efficiency and generalization. It introduces the concept of attention sink, which allows LLMs to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without fine-tuning. Experiments show that StreamingLLM can achieve up to 22.2x speedup over the baseline, with potential to create a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<p>
CRAFT is a tool creation and retrieval framework for LLMs that enables them to solve complex tasks with specialized toolsets. It provides a plug-and-play approach to adapt off-the-shelf LLMs to unseen domains and modalities, and experiments show substantial performance improvements compared to strong baselines.

<p>
This paper presents a new module-wise training technique, TRGL, which uses a regularization inspired by the minimizing movement scheme to address the stagnation problem of greedy layer-wise training. The technique has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research, as it can improve accuracy while using significantly less memory than end-to-end training.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17359v1>Language dynamics within adaptive networks: An agent-based approach of nodes and links coevolution (2309.17359v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a novel agent-based approach to modeling language dynamics in bilingual societies, allowing agents to adapt their local interactions in accordance with their language preference. Results suggest that this freedom to agents can lead to linguistically segregated communities, and the extinction of one of the languages in larger networks. The potential for these findings to create a lasting impact in academic research is significant, as they help us understand the impact of speakers' preferences and choices in the complex language landscape.</p>
