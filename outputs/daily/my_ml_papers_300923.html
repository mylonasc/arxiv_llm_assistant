<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16595v1>Can LLMs Effectively Leverage Structural Information for Graph Learning: When and Why (2309.16595v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage structural information in graph data to improve node classification tasks. Results suggest that LLMs can benefit from structural information, especially when textual node features are scarce, and that the performance of LLMs is strongly related to local homophily. These findings have the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research of the described techniques.</p>

<p>
This paper examines the potential of Chain-of-Thought prompting to improve the multi-step reasoning abilities of large language models. Results show that incorrect CoT prompting leads to poor accuracy, while correct values are crucial for predicting correct answers. This research has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by deepening our understanding of CoT prompting and opening new questions about LLMs' ability to learn reasoning in context.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16575v1>A Benchmark for Learning to Translate a New Language from One Grammar Book (2309.16575v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper introduces MTOB, a benchmark for learning to translate between English and Kalamang, a low-resource language with less than 200 speakers. Results show that current large language models are promising but fall short of human performance. This task framing could help expand access to language technology for underserved communities and create a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16620v1>Depthwise Hyperparameter Transfer in Residual Networks: Dynamics and Scaling Limit (2309.16620v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new hyperparameter tuning method for deep learning models, using $\mu$P parameterized networks and residual networks with a residual branch scale of $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. Experiments demonstrate that optimal hyperparameters transfer across width and depth, and theory supports this with a well-defined feature learning joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. This could have a lasting impact on academic research, reducing the cost of hyperparameter tuning.</p>
