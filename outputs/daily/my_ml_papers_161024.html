<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10759v1>SplitLLM: Collaborative Inference of LLMs for Model Placement and Throughput Optimization (2410.10759v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents SplitLLM, a collaborative inference architecture for large language models (LLMs) that optimizes throughput by distributing workload between a server and client devices. By considering available resources and using a dynamic programming-based algorithm, SplitLLM can significantly reduce server workload and improve throughput by 19%. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by increasing the efficiency and scalability of LLM inference.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10672v1>Large Language Model Evaluation via Matrix Nuclear-Norm (2410.10672v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new metric, the Matrix Nuclear-Norm, for evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs). This metric offers a faster and more efficient alternative to traditional metrics like Matrix Entropy, with a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \) and eliminating the need for SVD computation. The proposed Matrix Nuclear-Norm shows promising results in accurately assessing LLMs' performance and has the potential to significantly impact the evaluation of LLMs in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10743v1>NT-LLM: A Novel Node Tokenizer for Integrating Graph Structure into Large Language Models (2410.10743v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
NT-LLM is a new framework that efficiently encodes graph structures for use in Large Language Models (LLMs). By selecting key nodes and representing each node based on its relative distance to these anchors, NT-LLM effectively captures the graph topology and improves reasoning capabilities in LLMs. This has the potential to greatly enhance the performance of LLMs in graph-related tasks, making it a valuable tool for academic research in natural language processing.</p>

<p>
This paper presents a new framework that uses large language models to guide the selection of ranks in tensor network models for higher-order data analysis. By incorporating domain knowledge and interpretability, this approach has the potential to improve the effectiveness and understanding of rank choices. Experimental results on financial datasets demonstrate its potential for self-enhancement and applicability to various domains.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10714v1>SeedLM: Compressing LLM Weights into Seeds of Pseudo-Random Generators (2410.10714v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
SeedLM is a novel compression method for Large Language Models (LLMs) that uses seeds of pseudo-random generators to encode and compress model weights. It reduces memory access and leverages idle compute cycles during inference, effectively speeding up memory-bound tasks. Unlike other compression methods, SeedLM is data-free and generalizes well across diverse tasks. Experiments show that SeedLM achieves significantly better accuracy retention at lower bit precision, making it a promising technique for improving the efficiency and widespread deployment of LLMs in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10665v1>Double Jeopardy and Climate Impact in the Use of Large Language Models: Socio-economic Disparities and Reduced Utility for Non-English Speakers (2410.10665v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper highlights the potential benefits of large language models (LLMs) in bridging language and information gaps, particularly in developing nations. However, the analysis reveals that these benefits are largely skewed towards English speakers, creating socio-economic disparities and reduced utility for non-English speakers. This "double jeopardy" of higher costs and poor performance for low-resource languages also has a direct impact on climate. The paper emphasizes the need for fairer algorithm development to ensure lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10819v1>DuoAttention: Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference with Retrieval and Streaming Heads (2410.10819v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents DuoAttention, a framework that optimizes the use of long-context large language models (LLMs) by identifying and utilizing only the critical attention heads for processing long contexts. This approach significantly reduces memory consumption and speeds up decoding and pre-filling without compromising the LLM's long-context abilities. The potential for this technique to improve the efficiency and performance of LLMs could have a lasting impact on academic research in natural language processing.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10779v1>Focused ReAct: Improving ReAct through Reiterate and Early Stop (2410.10779v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
Focused ReAct is a new and improved version of the ReAct paradigm, which aims to enhance the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of large language models. By incorporating reiteration and early stop mechanisms, Focused ReAct addresses the challenges of losing focus and getting stuck in action loops. This has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and runtime of LLMs, making a lasting impact in academic research.</p>
