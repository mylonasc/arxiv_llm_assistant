<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02267v1>Structural Pruning of Pre-trained Language Models via Neural Architecture Search (2405.02267v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper discusses the potential of using neural architecture search (NAS) to prune pre-trained language models (PLM) such as BERT or RoBERTa. By finding sub-parts of the fine-tuned network that balance efficiency and generalization performance, NAS can help overcome challenges in deploying large PLMs for real-world applications. The use of two-stage weight-sharing NAS approaches can also accelerate the search process, making this technique a promising avenue for future research in the field of natural language understanding.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02246v1>What matters when building vision-language models? (2405.02246v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper highlights the importance of justifying design decisions in the development of vision-language models (VLMs). Through extensive experiments, the authors present Idefics2, an efficient VLM with 8 billion parameters, which achieves state-of-the-art performance and is often on par with larger models. The release of this model and its accompanying datasets has the potential to significantly impact and advance research in the field of VLMs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02134v1>Optimising Calls to Large Language Models with Uncertainty-Based Two-Tier Selection (2405.02134v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new approach for optimizing calls to large language models (LLMs) by using uncertainty-based two-tier selection. This method simplifies the decision-making process by using only the uncertainty of the small LLM's generations as the decision criterion, rather than relying on an additional neural model. The experiments show that this approach outperforms existing methods in balancing cost and performance, making it a promising technique for future research in this area.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02228v1>REASONS: A benchmark for REtrieval and Automated citationS Of scieNtific Sentences using Public and Proprietary LLMs (2405.02228v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a benchmark dataset, REASONS, for evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in generating citations for scientific sentences. The results show that augmenting relevant metadata can improve the performance of LLMs, and the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques can significantly reduce errors and improve citation support. However, LLMs still struggle with understanding context, highlighting the need for further research in this area. These findings have the potential to greatly impact the field of automated citation generation in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02086v1>Multi-level projection with exponential parallel speedup; Application to sparse auto-encoders neural networks (2405.02086v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new bi-level projection method for the $\ell_{1,\infty}$ norm, with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}\big(n m \big)$ for matrices and $\mathcal{O}\big(n + m \big)$ with full parallel power. This technique has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of sparse auto-encoders neural networks, with experiments showing a 2.5 times faster speed compared to the current fastest algorithm. This could have a lasting impact on the use of $\ell_{1,\infty}$ norm in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02219v1>FairEvalLLM. A Comprehensive Framework for Benchmarking Fairness in Large Language Model Recommender Systems (2405.02219v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating fairness in recommender systems powered by Large Language Models (RecLLMs). The framework addresses various dimensions of fairness and introduces counterfactual evaluations and diverse user group considerations. The authors demonstrate the utility of the framework through practical applications on two datasets and reveal some concerns regarding intrinsic fairness. This framework has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by providing a unified approach for evaluating fairness in RecLLMs.</p>
