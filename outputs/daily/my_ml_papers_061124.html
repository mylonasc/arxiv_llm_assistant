<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02335v1>Sparsing Law: Towards Large Language Models with Greater Activation Sparsity (2411.02335v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a comprehensive study on the correlation between activation sparsity and influential factors in large language models (LLMs). Through experiments, the authors find that ReLU is more efficient than SiLU as an activation function and that the activation ratio increases linearly with the width-depth ratio. They also discover that the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These findings have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable, potentially creating a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02280v1>The LLM Language Network: A Neuroscientific Approach for Identifying Causally Task-Relevant Units (2411.02280v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a neuroscientific approach for identifying causally task-relevant units in large language models (LLMs). By using the same localization approach as in neuroscience, the authors identify language-selective units within 18 popular LLMs and demonstrate their causal role in language processing. This provides evidence for specialization in LLMs and highlights the potential for this approach to have a lasting impact on academic research in understanding the functional organization of the brain.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02359v1>DeeR-VLA: Dynamic Inference of Multimodal Large Language Models for Efficient Robot Execution (2411.02359v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
DeeR-VLA is a framework that dynamically adjusts the size of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for efficient robot execution. By leveraging a multi-exit architecture and developing novel algorithms, DeeR reduces computational costs and GPU memory usage without compromising performance. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by enabling the development of MLLMs for real-world robots with limited computation and memory capacities.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02382v1>Improving Scientific Hypothesis Generation with Knowledge Grounded Large Language Models (2411.02382v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper discusses the potential impact of using large language models (LLMs) in scientific research, specifically in the context of hypothesis generation. While LLMs have shown great promise in this area, they are prone to generating inaccurate outputs. To address this issue, the authors propose KG-CoI, a system that integrates external knowledge from knowledge graphs to improve the accuracy of LLM-generated hypotheses. This has the potential to greatly enhance the quality and reliability of scientific research.</p>
