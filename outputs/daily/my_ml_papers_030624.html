<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20192v1>TAIA: Large Language Models are Out-of-Distribution Data Learners (2405.20192v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new method, called TAIA, for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in data-scarce domains with domain-mismatched data. By re-evaluating the Transformer architecture, the authors discovered that only fine-tuned attention parameters contribute positively to downstream performance. This insight led to the proposal of an effective inference-time intervention method, which showed superior improvements compared to other fine-tuning techniques in various scenarios. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research in the use of LLMs for specialized tasks using general data.</p>
