<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12120v1>LLMs on the Line: Data Determines Loss-to-Loss Scaling Laws (2502.12120v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the use of loss-to-loss scaling laws in guiding the development of large language models (LLMs). The authors investigate the factors that most strongly influence this scaling trend and find that pretraining data and tokenizer choice have the greatest impact. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting pretraining datasets for optimal downstream performance, while other factors can be optimized for training efficiency. These findings have the potential to significantly impact the development and use of LLMs in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12131v1>Transformer Dynamics: A neuroscientific approach to interpretability of large language models (2502.12131v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper proposes a novel framework for studying deep learning systems by applying dynamical systems approaches from neuroscience. By focusing on the residual stream in transformer models, the authors find that individual units exhibit strong continuity and unstable periodic orbits, leading to a better understanding of the internal mechanisms of these models. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research in the field of artificial intelligence and contribute to a "neuroscience of AI" that combines theory and data analysis.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12067v1>TokenSkip: Controllable Chain-of-Thought Compression in LLMs (2502.12067v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents TokenSkip, a technique that allows large language models (LLMs) to selectively skip less important tokens in order to reduce the length of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) outputs during inference. This results in a significant reduction in inference latency without compromising reasoning performance. This technique has the potential to greatly improve user experience and make LLMs more efficient in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12088v1>Meta-Statistical Learning: Supervised Learning of Statistical Inference (2502.12088v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new approach, called meta-statistical learning, which utilizes the success of large language models to tackle distribution-level tasks in academic research. By treating entire datasets as single inputs, this framework can predict distribution-level parameters and has shown strong performance in tasks such as hypothesis testing and mutual information estimation. This has the potential to greatly impact traditional machine learning pipelines and improve performance in statistical inference problems.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12150v1>Idiosyncrasies in Large Language Models (2502.12150v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores idiosyncrasies in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential impact on academic research. By fine-tuning existing text embedding models on LLM-generated texts, the authors achieve high classification accuracy, revealing that these idiosyncrasies are rooted in word-level distributions. These patterns persist even when the texts are rewritten, translated, or summarized, suggesting they are encoded in the semantic content. The authors also provide a code repository for further exploration and discuss the implications of their findings for training on synthetic data and inferring model similarity.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12134v1>SoftCoT: Soft Chain-of-Thought for Efficient Reasoning with LLMs (2502.12134v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents SoftCoT, a novel approach for continuous-space reasoning that enhances the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving complex reasoning tasks. By generating instance-specific soft thought tokens and mapping them into the LLM's representation space, SoftCoT avoids catastrophic forgetting and improves reasoning performance through supervised, parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This technique has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by enabling LLMs to excel in zero-shot settings and improve their reasoning capabilities.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12085v1>APB: Accelerating Distributed Long-Context Inference by Passing Compressed Context Blocks across GPUs (2502.12085v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents APB, a new framework for accelerating long-context inference in large language model applications. By leveraging multi-host approximate attention and a communication mechanism for key-value pairs, APB significantly improves prefill speed and enables faster processing of longer sequences. With impressive speedups compared to existing methods, APB has the potential to greatly enhance the efficiency and scalability of long-context inference in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12122v1>Minimal Ranks, Maximum Confidence: Parameter-efficient Uncertainty Quantification for LoRA (2502.12122v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a novel parameter-efficient Bayesian LoRA technique for uncertainty quantification in large language models. This approach achieves strong performance with improved calibration and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. The results suggest that effective uncertainty quantification can be achieved in low-dimensional parameter spaces, potentially creating a lasting impact in academic research by reducing storage and computational overhead.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12051v1>How to Upscale Neural Networks with Scaling Law? A Survey and Practical Guidelines (2502.12051v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper discusses the potential benefits of neural scaling laws in the design and optimization of large-scale AI models. While these laws have shown promise in improving model performance and optimizing computational resources, recent studies have highlighted their limitations in certain contexts. The paper suggests that while scaling laws can provide useful guidance, more nuanced approaches may be necessary for real-world applications.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12025v1>SafeChain: Safety of Language Models with Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Capabilities (2502.12025v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper "SafeChain: Safety of Language Models with Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Capabilities" addresses the potential safety risks associated with large reasoning models (LRMs) that use long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. The authors conduct a systematic study and find that LRMs are not safe compared to their reasoning capabilities. They propose a new safety training dataset, SafeChain, which can improve model safety without sacrificing performance. This has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by addressing the safety concerns of LRMs and improving their overall effectiveness.</p>
