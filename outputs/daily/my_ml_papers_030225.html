<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19392v1>Cache Me If You Must: Adaptive Key-Value Quantization for Large Language Models (2501.19392v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization technique for Key-Value caching in large language models (LLMs). By exploiting dependencies between keys and values and using high-compression mechanisms, AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates while maintaining high accuracy. This one-shot, simple, and efficient approach has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by enabling near-lossless inference at low bit rates for LLMs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19389v1>Federated Sketching LoRA: On-Device Collaborative Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models (2501.19389v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
FSLoRA is a new technique that combines federated fine-tuning and low-rank adaptation to efficiently fine-tune large language models on devices. By using a sketching mechanism, FSLoRA can adapt to varying device capabilities and constraints, resulting in improved performance compared to existing methods. Its rigorous convergence analysis and superior performance make it a promising approach for future academic research in this field.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19317v1>LLM-based Affective Text Generation Quality Based on Different Quantization Values (2501.19317v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the trade-off between quantization values and text quality in affective text generation using large language models. The findings show that reducing precision bits can significantly reduce computational resources, but at the cost of decreased accuracy and increased inference time. However, larger models at lower quantization levels generally outperform smaller, higher-precision models in terms of text quality, making this technique a potential cost-effective solution for researchers with limited resources.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19309v1>Judge Decoding: Faster Speculative Sampling Requires Going Beyond Model Alignment (2501.19309v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new technique called "judge decoding" that aims to accelerate autoregressive generation in large language models (LLMs). By incorporating a "judge" module that can recognize correct but non-aligned replies, the proposed method achieves a significant speedup of up to 9x while maintaining high quality results. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research in the field of LLMs by enabling faster and more efficient inference.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19324v1>Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding for Efficient LLM Reasoning (2501.19324v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new framework, Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), for improving the efficiency of inference in large language models (LLMs). RSD combines a lightweight draft model with a more powerful target model, using a process reward model to dynamically decide when to invoke the target model. The paper demonstrates that RSD achieves significant efficiency gains and better accuracy compared to existing methods, making it a promising approach for deploying LLMs in resource-intensive scenarios.</p>

The paper presents a simple approach to test-time scaling in language modeling, using extra compute to improve performance. By curating a small dataset and developing budget forcing techniques, the proposed model outperforms previous methods on competition math questions and shows potential for further improvement without test-time intervention. The open-source availability of the model, data, and code can have a lasting impact on academic research in this area.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19361v1>We're Different, We're the Same: Creative Homogeneity Across LLMs (2501.19361v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential impact of using large language models (LLMs) as creative assistants in academic research. While LLMs are marketed as helpful tools, previous studies have shown that they can limit the range of creative outputs. This paper investigates whether this limitation is specific to certain LLMs or a general effect of using LLMs as creative partners. The findings suggest that LLMs tend to produce similar outputs, which could have a lasting impact on the diversity of creative ideas in academic research.</p>
