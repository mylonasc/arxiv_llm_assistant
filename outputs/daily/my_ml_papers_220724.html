<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13623v1>Scaling Laws with Vocabulary: Larger Models Deserve Larger Vocabularies (2407.13623v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the impact of vocabulary size on the scaling of large language models (LLMs). Through various approaches, the authors show that larger models require larger vocabularies for optimal performance. However, most LLMs currently use smaller vocabularies, indicating a potential for significant improvements in downstream performance by increasing vocabulary size. This highlights the importance of considering both model parameters and vocabulary size in efficient scaling of LLMs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13657v1>FuLG: 150B Romanian Corpus for Language Model Pretraining (2407.13657v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents FuLG, a large Romanian corpus for language model pretraining, extracted from CommonCrawl. This corpus is significantly larger than existing Romanian corpora and can potentially have a lasting impact on academic research in the field of language models. The authors also provide a methodology for filtering the corpus and compare it to existing corpora through ablation studies.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13578v1>Large Language Models as Reliable Knowledge Bases? (2407.13578v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as reliable knowledge bases (KBs) in academic research. While previous studies suggest that LLMs can encode knowledge, this study defines criteria for evaluating their effectiveness as KBs, such as factuality and consistency. The results show that even high-performing LLMs are not reliable KBs, highlighting the need for further research in this area.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13744v1>LLMs as Function Approximators: Terminology, Taxonomy, and Questions for Evaluation (2407.13744v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper discusses the evolution of Natural Language Processing techniques from task-specific models to more general pre-trained models. It argues that the lack of clarity on what these models actually model has led to unhelpful metaphors and proposes a new approach of seeing them as function approximators. This framing brings up important questions about the quality, discoverability, stability, and protectability of these functions, making it a valuable framework for evaluating these models in both practical and theoretical contexts.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13565v1>dzFinNlp at AraFinNLP: Improving Intent Detection in Financial Conversational Agents (2407.13565v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper discusses the dzFinNlp team's contribution to improving intent detection in financial conversational agents. They experimented with various models and feature configurations, including traditional machine learning and deep learning methods, as well as transformer-based models. Their results show promising potential for these techniques to have a lasting impact on academic research in this field.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13696v1>Benchmark Agreement Testing Done Right: A Guide for LLM Benchmark Evaluation (2407.13696v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper discusses the importance of Benchmark Agreement Testing (BAT) in assessing the validity of benchmarks used to evaluate Language Models (LMs). It highlights the lack of standardized procedures for BAT and how this can lead to invalid conclusions, causing mistrust in benchmarks. The authors propose a set of best practices for BAT and introduce a python package and meta-benchmark to facilitate future research. This has the potential to greatly improve the robustness and validity of benchmark evaluations in the field of language model research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13647v1>Weak-to-Strong Reasoning (2407.13647v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper introduces a progressive learning framework that allows a strong language model to autonomously improve its reasoning capabilities without relying on a more advanced model or human-annotated data. Through experiments on various datasets, the method is shown to significantly enhance the reasoning abilities of the model. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by providing a more scalable and sophisticated approach to improving AI reasoning powers.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13709v1>Understanding Reference Policies in Direct Preference Optimization (2407.13709v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the impact of reference policies on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a popular training method for large language models. The authors investigate the optimal strength of the KL-divergence constraint in DPO, the necessity of reference policies, and the potential benefits of stronger reference policies. Their findings provide insights for best practices and identify open research questions for future studies, highlighting the potential for lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<p>
This paper presents a study on the effectiveness of using Sentence Transformers compared to TF-IDF features for detecting writers' stances on important topics such as COVID-19 vaccine, digital transformation, and women empowerment. The results show that Sentence Transformers outperform TF-IDF features and have the potential to improve stance detection models for addressing societal issues. This study has the potential to make a lasting impact in academic research on stance detection techniques.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13757v1>Black-Box Opinion Manipulation Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models (2407.13757v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the vulnerabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to black-box opinion manipulation attacks. By manipulating the ranking results of the retrieval model in RAG, the authors demonstrate the potential for these attacks to significantly alter the opinion polarity of generated content. This highlights the need for further research to enhance the reliability and security of RAG models, as well as the potential negative impact on user cognition and decision-making.</p>
