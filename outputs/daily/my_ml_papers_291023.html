<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17631v1>JudgeLM: Fine-tuned Large Language Models are Scalable Judges (2310.17631v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
JudgeLM presents a novel approach to evaluate LLMs in open-ended scenarios, by fine-tuning them as scalable judges. It introduces a comprehensive dataset, a new benchmark, and a bag of techniques to address potential biases. JudgeLM achieves state-of-the-art performance and surpasses human-to-human agreement, demonstrating potential for a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17513v1>The Expressive Power of Low-Rank Adaptation (2310.17513v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research. It provides theoretical analysis of the expressive power of LoRA, proving that for fully connected neural networks, LoRA can adapt any model to accurately represent any smaller target model with a certain LoRA-rank. For Transformer networks, it shows any model can be adapted to a target model of the same size with rank-$(\frac{\text{embedding size}}{2})$ LoRA adapters.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17488v1>LightLM: A Lightweight Deep and Narrow Language Model for Generative Recommendation (2310.17488v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper introduces LightLM, a lightweight Transformer-based language model for generative recommendation. It is designed to be deep and narrow, specifically tailored for direct generation of recommendation items, and is shown to outperform large-scale language models. The potential for LightLM to create a lasting impact in academic research is high, as it offers improved accuracy and efficiency for generative recommendation tasks.</p>

<p>
This paper presents an upgraded version of torchdistill, a coding-free deep learning framework, which enables reproducible research in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. The potential for this framework to create a lasting impact in academic research is demonstrated by reproducing the GLUE benchmark results of BERT models and reimplementing popular small-sized models and new knowledge distillation methods.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17526v1>Can large language models replace humans in the systematic review process? Evaluating GPT-4's efficacy in screening and extracting data from peer-reviewed and grey literature in multiple languages (2310.17526v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This study evaluates the efficacy of GPT-4, the largest language model to date, in the systematic review process. Results show that GPT-4 can rival human performance in certain tasks, such as screening full-text literature using highly reliable prompts. This suggests potential for LLMs to create a lasting impact in academic research by speeding up and automating systematic reviews.</p>
