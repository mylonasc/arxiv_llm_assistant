<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08515v1>The Paradox of Stochasticity: Limited Creativity and Computational Decoupling in Temperature-Varied LLM Outputs of Structured Fictional Data (2502.08515v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the impact of temperature settings and model architectures on the generation of structured fictional data using large language models. The study found that model architecture has a significant influence on computational efficiency, with certain models processing data much faster than others. However, adjusting temperature did not have a significant impact on processing time. The results highlight the importance of model selection over hyperparameter tuning for efficiency and suggest the need for diversity constraints to mitigate biases in synthetic data generation.</p>
