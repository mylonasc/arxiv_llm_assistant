<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12832v1>LaMDA: Large Model Fine-Tuning via Spectrally Decomposed Low-Dimensional Adaptation (2406.12832v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
LaMDA is a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models that leverages low-dimensional adaptation to significantly reduce trainable parameters and peak GPU memory usage. It gradually freezes projection matrices during the early stages of fine-tuning, resulting in up to 17.7x fewer parameter updates and 1.32x lower peak GPU memory usage. This technique has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of fine-tuning large language models in academic research.</p>
