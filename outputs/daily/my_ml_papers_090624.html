<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04289v1>What Languages are Easy to Language-Model? A Perspective from Learning Probabilistic Regular Languages (2406.04289v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for large language models to learn different classes of distributions over strings, specifically focusing on the learnability of regular languages. By evaluating neural language models on their ability to learn probabilistic regular languages, the study provides insights into the empirical learnability of these models. The results suggest that certain complexity parameters and the expected length of sampled strings are strong predictors of learnability, which could have a lasting impact on the use of language models in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04236v1>Understanding Information Storage and Transfer in Multi-modal Large Language Models (2406.04236v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the mechanisms of information storage and transfer in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which are increasingly used in real-world applications. By studying how MLLMs process information in a factual visual question answering task, the authors develop a method for tracing causal information in the multi-modal setting and create a test-bed of visual questions annotated with constraints. Their findings reveal the importance of certain blocks in MLLMs for information storage and transfer, and they introduce a model-editing algorithm that can improve the performance of these models. These insights have the potential to greatly impact the understanding and development of MLLMs in academic research.</p>
