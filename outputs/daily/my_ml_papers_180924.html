<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10516v1>RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector Retrieval (2409.10516v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to accelerate attention computation in Transformer-based large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging the dynamic sparse property of attention, RetrievalAttention builds approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes to retrieve the most relevant key-value (KV) vectors during generation. This significantly reduces the inference cost and GPU memory requirements for longer contexts, making it a promising technique for improving the scalability and efficiency of LLMs in academic research.</p>
