<p>
The paper presents \systemname{}, a novel framework for adaptive routing in Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach dynamically constructs and optimizes inference "paths" based on real-time feedback, addressing the limitations of static approaches. The contributions of this framework include adaptive model chain scheduling, multi-level collaborative verification, and synchronized state management. Preliminary experiments show promising results, indicating the potential for \systemname{} to have a lasting impact on the field of LLM inference.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07783v1>Relative Overfitting and Accept-Reject Framework (2505.07783v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper proposes a new framework, Accept-Reject (AR), to control noise effects in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs). By introducing the concept of "relative overfitting," the AR framework allows SLMs to positively influence LLM decision outputs, resulting in universal, stable, and effective performance improvements with lower parameter and computational costs. The potential of this approach in other machine learning domains, such as computer vision and AI for science, is also explored. This has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by helping to overcome existing bottlenecks in scaling laws.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07796v1>Learning Dynamics in Continual Pre-Training for Large Language Models (2505.07796v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the learning dynamics in Continual Pre-Training (CPT) for large language models and how it affects general and downstream domain performance. The authors derive a CPT scaling law that combines distribution shift and learning rate annealing, allowing for the prediction of loss at any training step and across learning rate schedules. This comprehensive understanding of CPT can be adapted to customize training hyper-parameters for different goals, leading to potential long-lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07784v1>Domain Regeneration: How well do LLMs match syntactic properties of text domains? (2505.07784v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to accurately approximate the distribution of their training data. By regenerating text from two commonly used domains, the authors investigate how well LLMs can match syntactic properties such as sentence length, readability, and dependency tag distribution. The findings suggest that LLMs may have a lasting impact on academic research by providing a more accurate representation of human text domains.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07735v1>Assessing the Chemical Intelligence of Large Language Models (2505.07735v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents the potential for large language models, specifically reasoning models, to significantly improve the abilities of advanced problem-solving in chemistry. The authors created a benchmark, ChemIQ, to assess the models' performance in organic chemistry tasks and found that they outperformed non-reasoning models. These models were also able to perform tasks such as converting SMILES strings and elucidating structures from NMR data, mirroring the reasoning process of a human chemist. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research in chemistry.</p>

This paper presents a novel approach to improve the performance of speech-text large language models (LLMs) on unseen tasks in spoken language understanding (SLU). By using randomized class labels for fine-tuning, the proposed method eliminates the need for task-specific data annotations, making it a promising alternative for SLU tasks with limited training data. This technique has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by enabling LLMs to cater to diverse SLU tasks without the need for task-specific training data.</p>
