<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18553v1>Retrofitting (Large) Language Models with Dynamic Tokenization (2411.18553v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper proposes retrofitting language models with dynamic tokenization, which allows for the dynamic determination of token boundaries based on input text. This approach has the potential to significantly improve efficiency and capabilities in languages other than English, as well as enable the use of LMs in new domains and languages. The findings suggest that this technique could have a lasting impact on academic research by promoting fairness and adaptability in language models.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18571v1>Challenges in Adapting Multilingual LLMs to Low-Resource Languages using LoRA PEFT Tuning (2411.18571v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the challenges of adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to low-resource languages and presents a technique called LoRA PEFT tuning. The study shows that while evaluation metrics may indicate a decline in performance, manual assessments suggest that the fine-tuned models actually outperform their original counterparts. This highlights the potential for LoRA PEFT tuning to improve target language generation capabilities in low-resource settings, but also emphasizes the need for improved evaluation methods and high-quality native datasets.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18444v1>Is my Meeting Summary Good? Estimating Quality with a Multi-LLM Evaluator (2411.18444v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents MESA, a framework for evaluating the quality of meeting summaries generated by natural language generation systems. MESA utilizes large language models (LLMs) and a multi-agent discussion process to detect errors and align with human judgment. It achieves high correlations with human evaluation and is adaptable to custom error guidelines, making it a valuable tool for improving the accuracy of NLG systems in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18620v1>Cross-modal Information Flow in Multimodal Large Language Models (2411.18620v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the inner workings of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and how they combine linguistic and visual information for tasks such as visual question answering. Through experiments, the authors identify two distinct stages in the integration process and provide a new perspective on how MLLMs process and combine information from different modalities. This could have a lasting impact on future research in multimodal information localization and editing.</p>
