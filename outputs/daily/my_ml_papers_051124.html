<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24049v1>Desert Camels and Oil Sheikhs: Arab-Centric Red Teaming of Frontier LLMs (2410.24049v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper examines the biases of large language models (LLMs) against Arabs and Westerners in various domains and evaluates their resistance to perpetuating these biases. The study finds that 79% of cases display negative biases towards Arabs, with LLMs such as LlaMA 3.1-405B being the most biased. Despite being an optimized version, GPT-4o is found to be the most vulnerable to biases and jailbreaks, highlighting the need for stronger bias mitigation strategies and security measures in LLMs.</p>
