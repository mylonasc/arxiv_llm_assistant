<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17810v1>Token Statistics Transformer: Linear-Time Attention via Variational Rate Reduction (2412.17810v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The Token Statistics Transformer (ToST) is a novel transformer attention operator that significantly reduces computational burden by scaling linearly with the number of tokens. This is achieved through a variational form of the maximal coding rate reduction objective. ToST has been shown to achieve competitive performance on various tasks while being more efficient and interpretable. This challenges the conventional belief that pairwise similarity attention mechanisms are crucial for transformer success. The potential for ToST to improve efficiency and interpretability in academic research is promising.</p>
