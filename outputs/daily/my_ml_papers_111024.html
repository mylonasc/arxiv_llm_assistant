<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07074v1>Let's Ask GNN: Empowering Large Language Model for Graph In-Context Learning (2410.07074v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper introduces AskGNN, a novel approach that integrates graph data and task-specific information into large language models (LLMs) through In-Context Learning (ICL). This approach, which employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-powered structure-enhanced retriever, shows superior effectiveness in graph task performance across three tasks and seven LLMs. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by enabling the use of LLMs for complex real-world systems without extensive fine-tuning.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07173v1>Do better language models have crisper vision? (2410.07173v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and represent the visual world. The authors propose a benchmark to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with the visual world and identify decoder-based LLMs as ideal candidates for this task. They also introduce ShareLock, a lightweight model that achieves impressive results on ImageNet with minimal training time and resources. These findings have the potential to significantly impact the use of LLMs in computer vision research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07041v1>Emergent properties with repeated examples (2410.07041v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential benefits of using repeated examples in training deep learning models. Through experiments on mathematical problems, the authors show that models trained on smaller sets of repeated examples outperform those trained on larger sets of single-use examples. They also demonstrate that a combination of repeated and random sampling can lead to faster learning and better performance. These findings have the potential to impact the understanding of generalization and memorization in deep learning.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07064v1>Data Selection via Optimal Control for Language Models (2410.07064v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a framework, PMP-based Data Selection (PDS), for selecting high-quality pre-training data from large corpora to improve the performance of language models (LMs) on downstream tasks. By solving the PMP conditions, PDS approximates optimal data selection and accelerates LM learning, leading to consistently improved performance across various model sizes. This technique has the potential to significantly impact academic research by improving data utilization and mitigating the quick exhaustion of available corpora.</p>
