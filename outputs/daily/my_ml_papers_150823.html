<h1>Unlocking the Potential of Large Language Models: Recent Machine Learning Research</h1>

<p>The potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize the telecom industry is being explored in recent machine learning research. LLMs have the potential to streamline tasks and improve operational efficiency, and research is being conducted to identify essential research directions to address the challenges of utilizing LLMs in the telecom domain. CELMOC, a framework for cost-effective language model choice, allows users to flexibly tune the cost-performance trade-off, and can reduce costs by up to 63% while matching the performance of the largest available language model. Additionally, six composable transformations have been identified that allow for the efficient expansion of transformer-based neural networks, preserving their functionality while increasing their capacity. A hyperparameter ablation study has been conducted to optimize a transformer-based machine translation model for single GPU training, and a novel approach to network management has been proposed, using large language models to generate code from natural language queries. This method offers potential benefits in terms of explainability, scalability, and privacy.
