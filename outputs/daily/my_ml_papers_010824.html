<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21018v1>ThinK: Thinner Key Cache by Query-Driven Pruning (2407.21018v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents ThinK, a query-driven pruning method for optimizing the memory consumption of large language models (LLMs) during inference. By selectively pruning the least significant channels in the key-value (KV) cache, ThinK reduces memory costs by over 20% without compromising model accuracy. This approach has the potential to significantly impact academic research in natural language processing by enabling more efficient deployment of LLMs without sacrificing performance.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20828v1>How to Measure the Intelligence of Large Language Models? (2407.20828v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential intelligence of large language models (LLMs) and the impact it may have on academic research. While LLMs have shown impressive capabilities, they also have limitations and issues with trustworthiness. The paper argues that the intelligence of LLMs should be evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative measures, rather than just task-specific statistical metrics. This could have a lasting impact on how LLMs are assessed and used in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20912v1>What Are Good Positional Encodings for Directed Graphs? (2407.20912v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the design of positional encodings (PE) for directed graphs, which are crucial in constructing powerful graph neural networks and transformers. The authors propose a new method, Multi-q Magnetic Laplacian PE, which effectively captures desired directed spatial relations. Their experiments show that this method outperforms previous PE methods in predicting directed distances and walk profiles, as well as in circuit design benchmarks. This has the potential to greatly impact the use of directed graphs in academic research, particularly in fields such as program analysis and circuit design.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20884v1>Effective Black Box Testing of Sentiment Analysis Classification Networks (2407.20884v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a method for improving the dependability of transformer-based sentiment analysis systems through comprehensive testing. By utilizing input space partitioning and a black-box approach, the proposed coverage criteria and generated tests have shown an average increase of 16% in test coverage and a corresponding decrease of 6.5% in model accuracy. This has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by providing a foundation for improving the dependability of these complex architectures.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20999v1>MoFO: Momentum-Filtered Optimizer for Mitigating Forgetting in LLM Fine-Tuning (2407.20999v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new fine-tuning algorithm, MoFO, which addresses the issue of knowledge forgetting in large language models (LLMs). MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance while keeping parameters closer to the pre-trained model, mitigating forgetting. It does not require access to pre-training data and does not alter the original loss function, making it suitable for fine-tuning scenarios where pre-training data is unavailable. Rigorous analysis and experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods. This technique has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research on LLM fine-tuning.</p>
