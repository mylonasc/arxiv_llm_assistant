<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12843v1>Towards Logically Consistent Language Models via Probabilistic Reasoning (2404.12843v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper proposes a new training objective for large language models (LLMs) that incorporates probabilistic reasoning to improve their consistency with external knowledge. This approach has the potential to address current issues with LLMs, such as generating non-factual information and contradicting themselves. By fine-tuning with this new objective, LLMs can become more logically consistent and better able to extrapolate to new factual knowledge. This could have a lasting impact on the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs in academic research.</p>
