<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08668v1>Promoting AI Equity in Science: Generalized Domain Prompt Learning for Accessible VLM Research (2405.08668v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents the Generalized Domain Prompt Learning (GDPL) framework, which aims to promote equitable and sustainable research in large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By leveraging small-scale domain-specific models and minimal prompt samples, GDPL enables the transfer of VLMs' robust recognition capabilities to specialized domains without the need for extensive data or resources. This has the potential to bridge the gap between academia and industry and facilitate state-of-the-art domain recognition performance in a prompt learning paradigm.</p>
