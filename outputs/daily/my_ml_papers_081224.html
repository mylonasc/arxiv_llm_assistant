<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04403v1>Establishing Task Scaling Laws via Compute-Efficient Model Ladders (2412.04403v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a novel approach for predicting task performance of pretrained language models in the overtrained setting. By using a two-step prediction approach and training a set of small-scale "ladder" models, the authors are able to accurately predict task performance of larger models while only using 1% of the compute. This technique has the potential to greatly benefit academic research by providing a more efficient and accurate way to establish task scaling laws.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04315v1>Densing Law of LLMs (2412.04315v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper introduces the concept of "capacity density" as a new metric for evaluating the quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) and describes the trend of LLMs in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. The analysis of recent open-source base LLMs reveals an empirical law (the densing law) that the capacity density of LLMs grows exponentially over time. This law provides new perspectives to guide future LLM development and emphasizes the importance of improving capacity density for optimal results with minimal computational overhead. The potential for this concept to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs could have a lasting impact on academic research in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04449v1>p-MoD: Building Mixture-of-Depths MLLMs via Progressive Ratio Decay (2412.04449v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new technique, p-MoD, for building efficient multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by leveraging the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism. This approach significantly reduces the training and inference costs of MLLMs, making them more accessible for academic research. The proposed designs, TanhNorm and STRing, along with the progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, fully unleash the potential of MoD and improve the efficiency and performance of the models. Extensive experiments show that p-MoD matches or even surpasses the performance of baseline models while using significantly fewer resources. This has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by making MLLMs more accessible and efficient.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04318v1>The Hyperfitting Phenomenon: Sharpening and Stabilizing LLMs for Open-Ended Text Generation (2412.04318v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents the concept of hyperfitting, which involves fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on small datasets to improve their long-sequence generative capabilities. This technique has shown promising results in open-ended text generation, surpassing even state-of-the-art LLMs in terms of diversity and human preferences. The potential for hyperfitting to greatly enhance LLMs and its applicability to various domains and tasks could have a lasting impact on academic research in this field.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04468v1>NVILA: Efficient Frontier Visual Language Models (2412.04468v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper introduces NVILA, a family of open visual language models (VLMs) that optimize both efficiency and accuracy. By scaling up spatial and temporal resolutions and compressing visual tokens, NVILA is able to efficiently process high-resolution images and long videos. It also reduces training costs and latency, while matching or surpassing the accuracy of other VLMs. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research in the field of visual language models.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04332v1>Liquid: Language Models are Scalable Multi-modal Generators (2412.04332v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
Liquid is a new auto-regressive generation paradigm that integrates visual comprehension and generation using a single large language model (LLM). This approach eliminates the need for external pretrained visual embeddings and shows a scaling law where performance drop decreases as model size increases. Liquid outperforms previous multimodal models and offers a scalable solution for enhancing vision-language understanding and generation.</p>
