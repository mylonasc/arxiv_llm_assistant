<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02040v1>Transformers as Transducers (2404.02040v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of using transformers as transducers, specifically in the context of sequence-to-sequence mapping. By using variants of the programming language RASP, the authors demonstrate that transformers have the ability to express a wide range of transductions, including first-order rational and regular functions. This has significant implications for academic research, as it provides a new perspective on the capabilities of transformers and their potential for use in various fields.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02060v1>Long-context LLMs Struggle with Long In-context Learning (2404.02060v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper introduces a specialized benchmark (LIConBench) to evaluate the performance of long-context LLMs in real-world scenarios, specifically in extreme-label classification tasks. The study reveals that while these models perform well under a token length of 20K, their performance significantly decreases when the context window exceeds 20K. This highlights the need for further improvement in the capabilities of LLMs to process and understand long, context-rich sequences. The LIConBench benchmark could serve as a more realistic evaluation for future long-context LLMs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02132v1>ViTamin: Designing Scalable Vision Models in the Vision-Language Era (2404.02132v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents ViTamin, a new vision model designed specifically for vision-language models (VLMs). It aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation protocol for vision models in the vision-language era, covering their zero-shot performance and scalability. ViTamin-L outperforms the default choice of vanilla Vision Transformers (ViTs) by 2.0% in ImageNet zero-shot accuracy, and ViTamin-XL with only 436M parameters achieves 82.9% accuracy, surpassing a model with ten times more parameters. This has the potential to significantly impact academic research in the field of vision-language models.</p>
