<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18014v1>Role-RL: Online Long-Context Processing with Role Reinforcement Learning for Distinct LLMs in Their Optimal Roles (2409.18014v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper proposes a new paradigm, Online Long-context Processing (OLP), to address the challenges of implementing and training large language models (LLMs) with long-context processing. Additionally, a Role Reinforcement Learning (Role-RL) framework is developed to automatically deploy different LLMs in their respective roles within the OLP pipeline. The experiments conducted on the OLP-MINI dataset show promising results, with an average recall rate of 93.2% and significant cost savings. This approach has the potential to greatly impact academic research in the field of natural language processing.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18028v1>Compositional Hardness of Code in Large Language Models -- A Probabilistic Perspective (2409.18028v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in performing multiple sub-tasks within the same context window, specifically in the context of code generation. The authors propose a probabilistic approach to quantify the "hardness of composition" in LLMs and suggest that distributing a decomposed problem among multiple LLMs may be more effective. This has the potential to significantly impact the use of LLMs in complex analytical tasks and could lead to further advancements in the field of natural language processing.</p>
