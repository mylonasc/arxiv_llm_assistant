<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14578v1>Large Language Models Are Overparameterized Text Encoders (2410.14578v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a method for reducing the size and inference time of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining strong performance as text embedding models. By pruning the last layers of an LLM before supervised training, the authors were able to achieve a significant reduction in memory and inference time. This method, along with a novel layer-pruning strategy, can have a lasting impact on academic research by making LLMs more accessible and efficient for text embedding tasks.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14570v1>Understanding the difficulty of low-precision post-training quantization of large language models (2410.14570v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for compressing the weights of large language models to very low numerical precision in order to improve efficiency. The study found that quantization-aware fine-tuning, which minimizes the global loss function, is more effective than post-training quantization, which minimizes local quantization errors. This highlights the importance of direct quantization-aware fine-tuning in the realm of large models at very low precision.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14480v1>Combining Entropy and Matrix Nuclear Norm for Enhanced Evaluation of Language Models (2410.14480v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a novel hybrid evaluation method for large language models (LLMs) that combines entropy and Matrix Nuclear Norm (MNN) techniques. By integrating these established methods, the proposed approach offers a comprehensive evaluation framework that balances accuracy with computational efficiency. The flexibility to adjust weightings between entropy and MNN allows for tailored evaluations for different objectives. This work contributes to the ongoing development of LLM evaluation and has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by providing deeper insights into model performance and opening avenues for future innovations in model assessment techniques.</p>

<p>
The paper presents EvoPress, a new evolutionary framework for dynamic compression of large language models (LLMs). This approach is provably optimal and has low sample and evaluation complexity, leading to highly competitive performance in terms of compression methods such as quantization, sparsification, and pruning. This has the potential to significantly impact academic research in LLM compression, setting new state-of-the-art results and providing a new frontier for further exploration.</p>

<p>
The paper presents a novel method, GenEOL, which utilizes the generative abilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance training-free sentence embeddings. This approach outperforms existing methods on various benchmarks and is robust to perturbations. The potential for GenEOL to improve representation quality and achieve notable gains in multiple tasks has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research on embedding techniques.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14461v1>The Propensity for Density in Feed-forward Models (2410.14461v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper examines the potential for pruning techniques to reduce the number of weights in neural networks without sacrificing performance. The study finds that the proportion of weights that can be pruned remains consistent across varying model sizes, indicating the potential for significant reduction in model complexity. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by allowing for more efficient and streamlined neural network models.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14675v1>Enhancing Large Language Models' Situated Faithfulness to External Contexts (2410.14675v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper discusses the potential benefits of enhancing large language models' (LLMs) situated faithfulness to external contexts. The authors propose two approaches, Self-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence Reasoning (RCR), to improve LLMs' ability to dynamically calibrate their trust in external information. Results show that these approaches can significantly improve LLMs' performance, highlighting promising avenues for future research in this area.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14669v1>NaturalBench: Evaluating Vision-Language Models on Natural Adversarial Samples (2410.14669v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
NaturalBench is a new benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) that aims to address the limitations of previous benchmarks by using natural adversarial samples and a vision-centric design. The benchmark consists of 10,000 human-verified VQA samples and evaluates 53 state-of-the-art VLMs, showing that these models still struggle with diverse visio-linguistic skills and are affected by biases. The benchmark has the potential to provide dynamic evaluations of VLMs using diverse data sources, making a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14641v1>Distance between Relevant Information Pieces Causes Bias in Long-Context LLMs (2410.14641v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper discusses the issue of positional bias in large language models (LLMs) and its impact on their ability to process long inputs. The authors present a benchmark, LongPiBench, to assess this bias when multiple relevant information pieces are involved. Experiments with various models reveal significant biases related to the spacing of relevant information pieces. This highlights the need to address and reduce positional biases in order to improve the capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications.</p>

This paper presents two simple approaches, Batch-Scheduled Sampling and Reference-Answer-based Correction, to address the discrepancy between training and inference in language models. By incorporating these strategies during training, the authors have observed improved performance in summarization, question-answering, and math question-answering tasks. These techniques have the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by improving the accuracy and reliability of language models in various applications.</p>
