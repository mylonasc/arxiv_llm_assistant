<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16950v1>Bottlenecked Transformers: Periodic KV Cache Abstraction for Generalised Reasoning (2505.16950v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a modification to the Transformer architecture, using Information Bottleneck theory, to improve generalization in reasoning tasks. By periodically transforming the internal sequence-level representations, the model is able to shift its focus towards encoding features that are most useful for predicting future tokens. This approach outperforms both vanilla Transformers and heuristic-driven pruning mechanisms, providing a principled framework for manipulating Transformer memory and addressing fundamental reasoning limitations.</p>

<p>
This paper presents a new method for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to streaming, which overcomes the limitations of existing approaches. By addressing key mismatches in input-attention and position-ID, the proposed group position encoding paradigm allows for efficient and scalable processing in both streaming and batch modes. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the potential for this technique to have a lasting impact in academic research on LLMs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16900v1>Power-Law Decay Loss for Large Language Model Finetuning: Focusing on Information Sparsity to Enhance Generation Quality (2505.16900v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper introduces a novel loss function, Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL), for optimizing the finetuning process in text generation tasks. By re-weighting the contribution of each token based on its frequency in the training corpus, PDL encourages the model to focus on learning and generating more specific and unique information. This has the potential to greatly enhance the quality, diversity, and informativeness of generated text, making it a valuable tool for various academic research areas such as abstractive summarization, dialogue systems, and style transfer.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16881v1>CASTILLO: Characterizing Response Length Distributions of Large Language Models (2505.16881v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents CASTILLO, a dataset that characterizes response length distributions of 13 large language models across 7 instruction-following corpora. This dataset allows for accurate estimation of response lengths, enabling proactive resource allocation for efficient inference. The analysis reveals significant variability in response lengths, providing a framework for studying model-specific generation behaviors. The release of this dataset and code promotes further research in the intersection of generative language modeling and systems.</p>

Dimple is a novel Discrete Diffusion Multimodal Large Language Model (DMLLM) that combines an initial autoregressive phase with a subsequent diffusion phase to address training instability and performance issues. It surpasses previous models in performance and offers a more efficient decoding strategy, as well as the ability to precisely control response format and length. This work demonstrates the potential for DMLLM to have a lasting impact on academic research in language modeling.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16956v1>On Multilingual Encoder Language Model Compression for Low-Resource Languages (2505.16956v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a novel approach for compressing multilingual encoder-only language models for low-resource languages. By combining existing techniques and taking them to the extreme, the proposed method achieves compression rates of up to 92% while maintaining essential language-specific knowledge. The results show only a marginal performance drop in downstream tasks, indicating the potential for long-lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16984v1>UFT: Unifying Supervised and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (2505.16984v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
UFT proposes a novel post-training method that combines the benefits of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This unified approach, called UFT, bridges the gap between memorization and thinking, leading to better generalization and faster convergence on long-horizon reasoning tasks. This has the potential to significantly impact academic research in the field of language models and their reasoning abilities.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16998v1>Do Large Language Models Excel in Complex Logical Reasoning with Formal Language? (2505.16998v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex logical reasoning tasks using formal languages. The study found that LLMs excel in these tasks, especially when formal language is employed. However, all LLMs have limitations in inductive reasoning capability. The use of a rejected fine-tuning method can enhance LLMs' ability to generalize across formal languages and achieve the best overall performance. This research has the potential to significantly impact academic research in the use of LLMs for complex logical reasoning tasks.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16959v1>Bigger Isn't Always Memorizing: Early Stopping Overparameterized Diffusion Models (2505.16959v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the mechanisms underlying generalization in diffusion probabilistic models, which are widely used in generative AI. The authors show that in highly overparameterized models, generalization is achieved during training before the onset of memorization. This has implications for hyperparameter transfer and privacy-sensitive applications, and suggests that a principled early-stopping criterion can optimize generalization while avoiding memorization.</p>
