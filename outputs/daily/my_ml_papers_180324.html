<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09636v1>Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference (2403.09636v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a method called Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC) for compressing key-value caches in large language models (LLMs) during inference, resulting in up to ~3.7x increase in throughput. DMC is applied through continued pre-training on a small percentage of the original data without adding extra parameters. It preserves the original downstream performance and can be combined with other techniques for compounded gains. This has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of LLMs in academic research.</p>
