<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10244v1>Efficient Continual Pre-training of LLMs for Low-resource Languages (2412.10244v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new approach for efficient continual pre-training (CPT) of open-source large language models (OsLLMs) for low-resource languages (LRLs). By selecting a subset of texts and tokens, the proposed technique significantly reduces the cost of CPT, making it more accessible for researchers.

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10271v1>Benchmarking Linguistic Diversity of Large Language Models (2412.10271v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper highlights the need for evaluating the linguistic diversity of Large Language Models (LLMs) in addition to their task-solving capabilities. The proposed framework for evaluating LLMs from various linguistic diversity perspectives has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by addressing concerns about the preservation of human linguistic richness in machine-generated language. The benchmarking of state-of-the-art LLMs and analysis of development and deployment choices can provide valuable insights for improving the linguistic diversity of LLM outputs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10257v1>Targeted Angular Reversal of Weights (TARS) for Knowledge Removal in Large Language Models (2412.10257v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new method, called Targeted Angular Reversal (TARS), for removing sensitive knowledge from large language models (LLMs). TARS is able to remove knowledge from all prompt directions, in multiple languages, without significantly degrading the overall performance of the model. It has the potential to make a lasting impact in academic research by providing a modular and efficient way to remove specific concepts from LLMs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10136v1>Can LLMs Convert Graphs to Text-Attributed Graphs? (2412.10136v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to automatically convert existing graphs into text-attributed graphs, which can then be used with graph neural networks (GNNs) for improved performance. The proposed method, Topology-Aware Node description Synthesis (TANS), integrates topological information with node properties to enhance the LLMs' ability to explain how graph topology influences node semantics. The results show that TANS enables a single GNN to operate across diverse graphs, even in the absence of textual information, showcasing the potential for LLMs to preprocess graph-structured data in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10281v1>One world, one opinion? The superstar effect in LLM responses (2412.10281v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper explores the potential impact of large language models (LLMs) on shaping global knowledge representation. The study reveals a "superstar effect" where a small number of figures dominate recognition across languages, highlighting the risk of narrowing perspectives and limiting diversity in information retrieval. This has implications for the lasting impact of LLMs on academic research and the need for diversity in language prompts to counteract this effect.</p>

This paper explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to improve open-domain semantic parsing, a challenging task that struggles with handling unseen concepts. The proposed Retrieval-Augmented Semantic Parsing (RASP) approach effectively integrates external lexical knowledge and significantly outperforms previous models in predicting unseen concepts. This highlights the potential impact of leveraging LLMs and retrieval mechanisms in advancing robust and open-domain semantic parsing in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10319v1>SCBench: A KV Cache-Centric Analysis of Long-Context Methods (2412.10319v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents SCBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cache-centric perspective. It addresses the challenges of computational and memory efficiency in long-context inference by analyzing four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. The evaluation on 8 long-context LLMs shows that dynamic sparsity and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures can significantly reduce memory usage while maintaining strong performance. This benchmark has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by providing a standardized and comprehensive evaluation of long-context methods, leading to more efficient and effective solutions in the field.</p>
