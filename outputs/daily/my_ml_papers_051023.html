<p>
ECoFLaP is a two-stage coarse-to-fine layer-wise pruning approach for large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that can efficiently compress model weights while maintaining performance. It leverages global importance scores to determine sparsity ratios, and local layer-wise unstructured weight pruning to achieve significant performance improvements in the high-sparsity regime.

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03016v1>Understanding In-Context Learning in Transformers and LLMs by Learning to Learn Discrete Functions (2310.03016v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper demonstrates that Transformers and LLMs can learn to learn discrete functions, leading to potential lasting impacts in academic research. Results show that Transformers can nearly match the optimal learning algorithm for simpler tasks, while their performance decreases on more complex tasks. Additionally, Transformers can learn to implement two distinct algorithms to solve a single task, and can adaptively select the more sample-efficient algorithm. Lastly, LLMs can compete with nearest-neighbor baselines on prediction tasks.</p>

xVal is a numerical encoding scheme that uses a single token to represent any real number, allowing large language models to be adapted for the analysis of scientific datasets. This strategy renders the model end-to-end continuous, leading to improved generalization and token-efficiency, with potential to create a lasting impact in academic research.</p>
