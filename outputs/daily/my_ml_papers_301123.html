<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17892v1>A Pipeline For Discourse Circuits From CCG (2311.17892v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
DisCoCirc is a new model for meaning that bridges the gap between linguistic theory and modern NLP practice. It provides a way to represent natural language text as a 'circuit' that captures the core semantic information, and can be interpreted as modular machine learning models. This paper presents a software pipeline that converts English text to its DisCoCirc representation, and has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by enabling the application of the DisCoCirc framework to NLP tasks, both classically and quantumly.</p>
