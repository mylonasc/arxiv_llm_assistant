<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03247v1>Unveiling Factual Recall Behaviors of Large Language Models through Knowledge Neurons (2408.03247v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper investigates the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively recall and utilize their internal repositories of factual knowledge when faced with reasoning tasks. Through the use of Knowledge Neurons, the authors reveal that LLMs often fail to harness critical factual associations and instead rely on shortcut pathways. However, by enhancing the recall process, reasoning performance can be improved. Additionally, the use of Chain-of-Thought prompting can further enhance the recall of factual knowledge and improve reasoning. The authors also explore how contextual conflicts can impact the retrieval of facts during reasoning. Overall, this research has the potential to significantly impact academic research by providing insights into the factual recall behaviors of LLMs and techniques for improving reasoning performance.</p>
