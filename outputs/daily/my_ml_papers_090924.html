<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03621v1>Attend First, Consolidate Later: On the Importance of Attention in Different LLM Layers (2409.03621v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the role of attention in decoder-based LLMs and its impact on performance. By manipulating the representations of previous tokens, the study shows that the importance of attention in the top layers of the model may be overestimated. This suggests a two-stage process in transformer-based LLMs, with the first stage gathering input from previous tokens and the second stage processing that information internally. These findings have the potential to significantly impact academic research on LLM techniques.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03733v1>Planning In Natural Language Improves LLM Search For Code Generation (2409.03733v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a novel search algorithm, PLANSEARCH, which utilizes natural language planning to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in code generation tasks. By searching over diverse plans in natural language, PLANSEARCH outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on a contamination-free benchmark. The potential for this technique to significantly improve LLM search and generate diverse solutions has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03662v1>The representation landscape of few-shot learning and fine-tuning in large language models (2409.03662v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential impact of two common strategies, in-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the performance and internal representations of large language models (LLMs). Through analyzing the probability landscape of hidden representations, the study reveals that these strategies create distinct structures within the LLMs, providing insights for designing optimal methods to extract information from these models. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research in the field of natural language processing.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03735v1>LLM-CI: Assessing Contextual Integrity Norms in Language Models (2409.03735v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents LLM-CI, a framework for assessing privacy norms encoded in large language models (LLMs). This is crucial as LLMs are integrated into sociotechnical systems and their encoded norms should align with societal expectations. LLM-CI uses a Contextual Integrity-based factorial vignette methodology and a multi-prompt assessment to address prompt sensitivity. This framework has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by providing a comprehensive and reliable methodology for evaluating LLMs and their encoded norms.</p>

<p>
This paper presents a technique for predicting the performance of new LLMs on individual task instances using a small set of reference instances and a generic assessor.
