<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22296v1>LLMs are Highly-Constrained Biophysical Sequence Optimizers (2410.22296v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) as highly-constrained optimizers in biophysical sequence optimization tasks. The proposed methodology, LLOME, combines offline and online optimization and introduces a novel training objective, MargE, to improve the performance of LLMs. The study also introduces a synthetic test suite for rapid evaluation of LLMs. Results show that LLMs outperform genetic algorithm baselines in terms of solution quality and efficiency, but also exhibit some limitations.

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22244v1>Abrupt Learning in Transformers: A Case Study on Matrix Completion (2410.22244v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the phenomenon of abrupt learning in Transformers, where the training loss plateaus and then sharply drops to near-optimal values. By formulating a low-rank matrix completion problem as a masked language modeling task, the authors demonstrate the potential for BERT models to solve this task with low error. The sudden drop in loss is accompanied by interpretability insights, providing potential for lasting impact in understanding and improving training dynamics in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22307v1>SVIP: Towards Verifiable Inference of Open-source Large Language Models (2410.22307v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents SVIP, a secret-based verifiable inference protocol for open-source large language models (LLMs). This addresses the issue of computing service providers potentially substituting requested LLMs with smaller, less capable models without user consent. SVIP leverages intermediate outputs from LLMs as unique model identifiers and integrates a secret mechanism for enhanced security. Extensive experiments show that SVIP is accurate, generalizable, efficient, and resistant to attacks, making it a promising solution for ensuring honest inference in academic research.</p>
