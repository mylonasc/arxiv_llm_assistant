<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17691v1>Low-Bit Quantization Favors Undertrained LLMs: Scaling Laws for Quantized LLMs with 100T Training Tokens (2411.17691v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the impact of low-bit quantization on large language models (LLMs) and reveals that undertrained LLMs benefit more from low-bit quantization compared to fully trained models. The authors derive scaling laws to understand the relationship between quantization-induced degradation (QiD) and factors such as model size and training tokens. This provides a novel perspective for measuring an LLM's training level and predicting quantization performance for future models. The release of 1500+ quantized checkpoints allows for further research in this area.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17525v1>Pushing the Limits of Large Language Model Quantization via the Linearity Theorem (2411.17525v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new approach to quantizing large language models, using a "linearity theorem" to establish a direct relationship between reconstruction error and model perplexity. This insight allows for the development of two novel applications, including a data-free quantization method that outperforms existing approaches. The practical implications of this research include improved accuracy-compression trade-offs and efficient support for quantization in LLMs, potentially leading to lasting impact in academic research on these techniques.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17685v1>Attamba: Attending To Multi-Token States (2411.17685v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
Attamba is a new architecture that combines state-space models and attention mechanisms to improve the efficiency and performance of predicting the next token in a sequence. By compressing chunks of tokens and applying attention on these compressed representations, Attamba achieves a 24% improvement in perplexity with similar computational resources and a smooth transition between quadratic and linear scaling. This technique has the potential to significantly impact academic research by offering adaptable efficiency gains and improving model quality.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17686v1>Rethinking Token Reduction in MLLMs: Towards a Unified Paradigm for Training-Free Acceleration (2411.17686v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a unified paradigm for training-free token reduction in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to accelerate inference. The proposed paradigm, "filter-correlate-compress," decomposes token reduction into three stages and offers a suite of methods that balance speed and accuracy. Experimental results show significant reduction in FLOPs with minimal impact on performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. This paradigm has the potential to greatly impact academic research in the field of MLLMs and accelerate the development of more efficient models.</p>
