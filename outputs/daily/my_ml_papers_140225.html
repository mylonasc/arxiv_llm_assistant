<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09622v1>Theoretical Benefit and Limitation of Diffusion Language Model (2502.09622v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the Masked Diffusion Model (MDM), a type of diffusion language model, and its effectiveness in text generation. The study finds that MDMs can achieve near-optimal perplexity without sacrificing performance, but require linearly scaling sampling steps for "correct" sequences. This analysis provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the potential benefits and limitations of MDMs in academic research on text generation.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09604v1>SelfCite: Self-Supervised Alignment for Context Attribution in Large Language Models (2502.09604v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
SelfCite is a self-supervised approach that uses context ablation to align large language models (LLMs) and generate high-quality citations. This approach reduces the need for costly and labor-intensive annotations, making it a potentially impactful technique for academic research. By leveraging the LLM's own reward signal, SelfCite can significantly improve citation quality and can be used to fine-tune models for better citation generation. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by a significant increase in citation F1 on a benchmark dataset.</p>
