<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12224v1>Length Generalization of Causal Transformers without Position Encoding (2404.12224v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of using NoPE (Transformers without position encodings) to improve the length generalization of language models. The authors identify a connection between NoPE's limited context length and the distraction of attention distributions, and propose a parameter-efficient tuning method to expand its context size. Experiments show that NoPE can achieve competitive performances in long sequence language modeling and other tasks, making it a promising technique for future research in this area.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12362v1>Transformer tricks: Removing weights for skipless transformers (2404.12362v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
He and Hofmann introduced a skipless transformer that removes the V and P linear layers, reducing the number of weights and improving efficiency. This technique is applicable to MHA but not MQA and GQA, commonly used in popular LLMs. The paper proposes mathematically equivalent versions for these schemes, potentially reducing compute and memory complexity by 15%. This could have a lasting impact on the efficiency of transformer-based research.</p>
