<p>
This paper explores the potential of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Through experiments on MATH-500 and AIME24, the authors demonstrate that TTS can significantly enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs, with smaller models outperforming larger ones. This highlights the importance of adapting TTS strategies to the specific characteristics of each task and model, and suggests a promising avenue for future research in this area.</p>
