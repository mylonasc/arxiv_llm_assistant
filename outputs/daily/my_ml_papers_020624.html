<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20202v1>One QuantLLM for ALL: Fine-tuning Quantized LLMs Once for Efficient Deployments (2405.20202v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new approach for efficiently deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) by training a once-for-all (OFA) supernet that can generate optimal subnets for different applications. The proposed technique addresses the challenges of lengthy training and interference from weight sharing in current methods. By incorporating Low-Rank adapters and a non-parametric scheduler, the approach achieves high performance while significantly reducing deployment time for diverse scenarios. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research in the field of LLMs by providing a more efficient and effective method for deploying these models.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20339v1>Visual Perception by Large Language Model's Weights (2405.20339v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a novel approach for incorporating visual information into Large Language Models (LLMs) by aligning visual features with model weights instead of input space alignment. This method, called VLoRA, significantly reduces computational costs for both training and inference while achieving comparable performance on various benchmarks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The open-source code and models have the potential to greatly impact academic research in this field.</p>

<p>
The paper introduces KerasCV and KerasNLP, domain packages that extend the Keras API for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing workflows. These packages offer fast experimentation, ease-of-use, and high performance, with a modular and layered design. They also provide pretrained "task" models for popular architectures, allowing for efficient training and fine-tuning.

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20192v1>TAIA: Large Language Models are Out-of-Distribution Data Learners (2405.20192v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new method, called TAIA, for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in data-scarce domains with domain-mismatched data. By re-evaluating the Transformer architecture, the authors discovered that only fine-tuned attention parameters are particularly beneficial in these scenarios. Their proposed method, \trainallInfAttn, achieves superior improvements compared to traditional fine-tuning methods, making it resistant to jailbreaking tuning and enhancing specialized tasks using general data. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by providing a more effective and efficient way to improve LLM performance in data-scarce domains.</p>
