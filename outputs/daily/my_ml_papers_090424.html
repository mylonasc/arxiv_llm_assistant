<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04163v1>Dwell in the Beginning: How Language Models Embed Long Documents for Dense Retrieval (2404.04163v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for Transformer-based models to improve text representation learning for web document retrieval. It builds on previous research that identified a loss of information in the middle of input sequences for causal language models and extends it to representation learning. The study shows that contrastive pre-training and fine-tuning can significantly improve the model's ability to capture early contents of the input, potentially leading to lasting impacts in academic research on text representation learning.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04066v1>VoicePilot: Harnessing LLMs as Speech Interfaces for Physically Assistive Robots (2404.04066v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
VoicePilot utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as speech interfaces for physically assistive robots, allowing individuals with motor impairments or disabilities to effectively communicate high-level commands and preferences. Through iterative testing and evaluation with older adults, the framework is validated and design guidelines for using LLMs as assistive robot interfaces are provided. This has the potential to greatly improve the well-being and independence of individuals with disabilities, making a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04067v1>CLUE: A Clinical Language Understanding Evaluation for LLMs (2404.04067v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents CLUE, a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance and applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world clinical tasks. This addresses the current gap in evaluation methods, which primarily focus on non-clinical tasks and do not reflect the complexity of practical clinical applications. By providing insights into the clinical performance of biomedical and general domain LLMs, CLUE has the potential to drive future model development towards meeting the real-world needs of clinical application.</p>
