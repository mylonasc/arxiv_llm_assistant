<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14770v1>Determining Layer-wise Sparsity for Large Language Models Through a Theoretical Perspective (2502.14770v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a theoretical approach to determining layer-wise sparsity rates for large language models (LLMs) that mitigates the issue of "reconstruction error explosion." Through this method, the optimal sparsity rates can be identified with just a few trials, leading to improved performance of sparse LLMs across various architectures and compression techniques. This has the potential to significantly impact academic research in the field of LLMs and related areas such as vision and multimodal models.</p>

<p>
The paper presents EAGER-LLM, a decoder-only large language model (LLM)-based generative recommendation framework that integrates endogenous and exogenous behavioral and semantic information in a non-intrusive manner. This approach addresses challenges faced by existing LLM-based recommender systems, such as inefficient collaborative learning and poor integration of traditional RS features.
