<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21018v1>ThinK: Thinner Key Cache by Query-Driven Pruning (2407.21018v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper "ThinK: Thinner Key Cache by Query-Driven Pruning" proposes a novel method for optimizing the memory consumption of large language models (LLMs) during inference. By selectively pruning the least significant channels in the key-value (KV) cache, ThinK reduces memory costs by over 20% without compromising model accuracy. This technique has the potential to significantly impact academic research in natural language processing by enabling more efficient deployment of LLMs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20999v1>MoFO: Momentum-Filtered Optimizer for Mitigating Forgetting in LLM Fine-Tuning (2407.20999v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new fine-tuning algorithm, MoFO, for large language models (LLMs) that mitigates knowledge forgetting during the fine-tuning stage. MoFO achieves similar performance to full-parameter training while keeping parameters closer to the pre-trained model, making it suitable for scenarios where pre-training data is unavailable. It also does not alter the original loss function, avoiding any potential impairment of model performance. This technique has the potential to significantly impact academic research in the field of LLM fine-tuning by improving performance and mitigating forgetting.</p>
