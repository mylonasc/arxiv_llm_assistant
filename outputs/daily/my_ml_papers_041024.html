<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02724v1>Large Language Models as Markov Chains (2410.02724v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to have a lasting impact on academic research by drawing an equivalence between LLMs and Markov chains. The authors derive surprising findings related to the performance and convergence of LLMs, and prove pre-training and generalization bounds. Through experiments, they demonstrate how this equivalence enriches our understanding of LLMs and their behavior in practice.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02703v1>Selective Attention Improves Transformer (2410.02703v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
Selective Attention is a simple yet effective technique that improves language modeling performance in various transformer models. It reduces the attention given to unneeded elements, resulting in equivalent performance to standard transformers with significantly fewer parameters and less memory requirements. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by allowing for more efficient and resource-friendly models without sacrificing performance.</p>

<p>
This paper introduces a new generative self-evaluation scheme for large language models (LLMs) that can predict mid-generation if generating more samples will improve performance. This reduces the need for an external reward model and can significantly improve efficiency and scalability in LLM inference. The results show promising potential for lasting impact in academic research on LLM techniques.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02631v1>Large Language Model for Multi-Domain Translation: Benchmarking and Domain CoT Fine-tuning (2410.02631v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) in improving multi-domain machine translation (MT). A comprehensive benchmark is established, revealing a performance gap between LLMs and traditional MT systems due to domain overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this, a domain CoT fine-tuning technique is proposed, resulting in notable enhancements in translation accuracy and domain robustness. This has the potential to greatly impact the field of multi-domain MT research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02694v1>HELMET: How to Evaluate Long-Context Language Models Effectively and Thoroughly (2410.02694v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents HELMET, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs). It addresses issues with previous benchmarks, such as low coverage and unreliable metrics, and offers a more reliable and consistent ranking of LCLMs. Through a study of 51 models, it shows that synthetic tasks are not good predictors of downstream performance and that open-source models lag behind closed ones in tasks requiring full-context reasoning. The authors recommend using their RAG tasks for fast model development and advocate for a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research on LCLMs by providing a more comprehensive and reliable benchmark for evaluating these models.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02660v1>How to Train Long-Context Language Models (Effectively) (2410.02660v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of continued training and supervised fine-tuning of language models to effectively utilize long-context information. Through robust evaluations and thorough experiments, the authors determine the optimal data mix and design choices for training these models. The resulting model, ProLong-8B, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on long-context tasks and can effectively process up to 512K tokens, making it a valuable tool for academic research in natural language processing.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02742v1>Grounding Large Language Models In Embodied Environment With Imperfect World Models (2410.02742v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper proposes a technique called GLIMO, which uses proxy world models to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in physical reasoning and robotics tasks. The approach incorporates an LLM agent-based data generator and has shown significant performance improvements in various benchmarks. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by enabling LLMs to tackle real-world problems more effectively.</p>

The paper presents MA-RLHF, a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates macro actions to address the credit assignment problem in token-level RLHF. By operating at a higher level of abstraction, MA-RLHF reduces the temporal distance between actions and rewards, resulting in faster and more accurate credit assignment. Extensive experiments show significant performance improvements in various tasks, making MA-RLHF a promising technique for enhancing learning efficiency in academic research.</p>
