<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07839v1>RecurrentGemma: Moving Past Transformers for Efficient Open Language Models (2404.07839v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
RecurrentGemma is a new open language model that utilizes Google's Griffin architecture, combining linear recurrences and local attention for efficient performance. With a fixed-sized state, it reduces memory usage and allows for efficient inference on long sequences. The pre-trained model with 2B non-embedding parameters and the instruction tuned variant show comparable performance to Gemma-2B, despite being trained on fewer tokens. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research in language modeling.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07904v1>HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion (2404.07904v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents HGRN2, a new technique for improving the performance and training speed of language modeling and image classification tasks. By introducing a state expansion mechanism inspired by linear attention, HGRN2 significantly increases the recurrent state size without adding extra parameters, making it more efficient for hardware training. The experiments show that HGRN2 outperforms previous models and performs competitively with other open-source models, making it a promising technique for future academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07979v1>LLoCO: Learning Long Contexts Offline (2404.07979v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents LLoCO, a technique for processing long contexts in large language models (LLMs) that combines context compression, retrieval, and parameter-efficient finetuning. This approach extends the effective context window of a 4k token LLM to handle up to 128k tokens, resulting in significantly improved performance and a $7.62\times$ speed-up. This technique has the potential to greatly impact academic research by enabling more efficient and accurate processing of long contexts in LLMs.</p>
