<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12109v1>Linguistic Structure from a Bottleneck on Sequential Information Processing (2405.12109v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the fundamental properties of human language, such as systematicity and locality, and how they arise from the principle of minimizing excess entropy. Through simulations and cross-linguistic studies, the authors demonstrate that human languages are structured to have low excess entropy at various levels. This suggests that the structure of human language may have evolved to minimize cognitive load and maximize communicative expressiveness, potentially impacting future research in this field.</p>
