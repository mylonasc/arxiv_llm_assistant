<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17324v1>Modularity in Transformers: Investigating Neuron Separability & Specialization (2408.17324v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the modularity and task specialization of neurons in transformer models, specifically in vision and language models. Through selective pruning and MoEfication clustering techniques, the authors identify task-specific neuron clusters with varying degrees of overlap between related tasks. These findings suggest an inherent structure in transformer models that can be refined through training, providing potential avenues for improving model interpretability and efficiency.</p>

<p>
This paper evaluates the performance and self-evaluation capabilities of three language models in classification tasks related to environmental and climate change. While BERT-based models generally outperform the generative models, the latter still show promise. The study also highlights the strengths and limitations of these models in addressing urgent ecological issues, contributing to the ongoing discussion on their utility in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17377v1>NDP: Next Distribution Prediction as a More Broad Target (2408.17377v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new technique called Next Distribution Prediction (NDP) that addresses the limitations of the existing Next-Token Prediction (NTP) paradigm used in large language models (LLMs). By using $n$-gram distributions instead of one-hot targets, NDP shows significant improvements in various tasks such as translation, general tasks, and medical domain adaptation. This highlights the potential for NDP to have a lasting impact on academic research in improving NTP and LLMs.</p>
