<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17084v1>Token-by-Token Regeneration and Domain Biases: A Benchmark of LLMs on Advanced Mathematical Problem-Solving (2501.17084v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper evaluates the performance of 10 large language models (LLMs) on advanced mathematical problem-solving tasks. The study introduces a new evaluation framework and finds a significant performance gap between the top commercial model and the least effective open-source model. The use of token-by-token regeneration shows a trade-off between efficiency and precision, and the study suggests that hybrid reasoning methods may be beneficial for solving these complex problems. These findings have the potential to impact future research in the use of LLMs for mathematical problem-solving.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17047v1>How Linguistics Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Language Models (2501.17047v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper discusses the potential impact of language models on academic research in linguistics. While some argue that language models do not truly learn language and therefore have limited value in studying human learning and processing, others claim that their success eliminates the need for studying linguistic theory. The authors argue that both extremes are incorrect and that language models can contribute to fundamental questions about linguistic structure, language processing, and learning, while also informing major questions in linguistic theory. However, they do not replace the need for linguistic structure and theory.</p>
