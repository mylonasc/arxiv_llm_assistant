<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14395v1>PARAMANU-GANITA: Language Model with Mathematical Capabilities (2404.14395v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
Paramanu-Ganita is a new language model with mathematical capabilities, trained on a curated mixed mathematical corpus. Despite being significantly smaller than other generalist and math-specialized language models, it outperforms them in accuracy and requires less training time. This suggests that powerful domain-specific language models can be created without the need for giant models and immense computing power, potentially making a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14372v1>Beyond Scaling: Predicting Patent Approval with Domain-specific Fine-grained Claim Dependency Graph (2404.14372v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the limitations of model scaling in language tasks and presents a novel approach, Fine-grained cLAim depeNdency (FLAN) Graph, for predicting patent approval. The authors demonstrate that incorporating FLAN Graph through various graph models consistently outperforms large language models, highlighting the potential for this technique to have a lasting impact in academic research on patent approval prediction.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14387v1>A Survey on Self-Evolution of Large Language Models (2404.14387v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a survey on the potential benefits of self-evolution approaches in large language models (LLMs). These approaches allow LLMs to autonomously acquire, refine, and learn from experiences generated by the model itself, potentially leading to superintelligence. The paper outlines a conceptual framework and categorizes the evolution objectives of LLMs, providing insights and future directions for researchers to improve self-evolution frameworks and advance the development of self-evolving LLMs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14270v1>What do Transformers Know about Government? (2404.14270v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of transformer language models, specifically BERT, to encode information about government relations in natural language. Through experiments with probing classifiers and data from two languages, the authors demonstrate that this information is present across all transformer layers, with a small number of attention heads being able to identify new types of government. The release of the Government Bank dataset provides valuable resources for future research on grammatical constructions and government relations.</p>
