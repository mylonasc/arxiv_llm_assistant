<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24049v1>Desert Camels and Oil Sheikhs: Arab-Centric Red Teaming of Frontier LLMs (2410.24049v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper examines the biases of large language models (LLMs) against Arabs and Westerners in various domains and evaluates their resistance to perpetuating these biases. The study finds that most LLMs display negative biases towards Arabs and are vulnerable to "jailbreak" prompts that exaggerate negative traits. This highlights the need for stronger bias mitigation strategies and security measures in LLMs to create a lasting impact in academic research.</p>
