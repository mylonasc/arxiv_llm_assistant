<h1>Unlocking the Potential of Machine Learning Research: Recent Breakthroughs</h1>

<p>Recent developments in machine learning research have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology. From Orthogonal Butterfly (BOFT), a parameter-efficient finetuning technique for adapting large foundation models to downstream tasks, to LoGiPT, a novel language model that directly emulates the reasoning processes of logical solvers, the possibilities are endless. 

The potential of large language models (LLMs) to transform democratic societies has been explored, with the difficulty in distinguishing machine-generated texts from human output and the potential risks associated with an overreliance on LLMs being examined. Education has been proposed as a solution to mitigate these risks, advocating for the development and usage of LLMs to augment human capacities in thinking, deliberating and decision-making.

Few-shot and LLM techniques have been explored to enable cost-effective text classification in data-limited domains, such as banking. Results show that LLMs can be effective with as little as 1-5 examples per class, and that cost-effective querying and data augmentation methods can further improve performance.

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06243v1>Parameter-Efficient Orthogonal Finetuning via Butterfly Factorization (2311.06243v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents Orthogonal Butterfly (BOFT), a parameter-efficient finetuning technique for adapting large foundation models to downstream tasks. BOFT is based on an information transmission perspective and uses butterfly structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. Experiments show that BOFT can create a lasting impact in academic research by providing better generalizability and improved parameter-efficiency.</p>
