<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04661v1>Assessing Language Comprehension in Large Language Models Using Construction Grammar (2501.04661v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a novel evaluation method for assessing natural language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging Construction Grammar (CxG). The results show that while LLMs demonstrate some knowledge of constructional information, they struggle with abstract meanings conveyed by Cxns, highlighting key limitations in their semantic capabilities. This approach has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by providing a more targeted and reliable assessment of LLMs' understanding of language.</p>
