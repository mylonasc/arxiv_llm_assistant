<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02446v1>Predicting vs. Acting: A Trade-off Between World Modeling & Agent Modeling (2407.02446v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper discusses the trade-off between world modeling and agent modeling in RLHF-aligned language models (LMs). While these models have shown impressive performance in benchmarks and long-form text generation, they struggle with next-token prediction. The authors propose that this trade-off is due to the models' focus on coherent long-form generation, which restricts randomness and limits their ability to generate documents without specific anchor spans. This trade-off may continue to exist even as alignment techniques improve, highlighting the potential impact of these techniques on academic research in this field.</p>
