This paper investigates the potential impact of different finetuning methods on reducing bias and toxicity in non-English languages for large language models. The results show that finetuning on curated non-harmful text is more effective for mitigating bias, while finetuning on direct preference optimization datasets is more effective for mitigating toxicity.
