<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07633v1>ChocoLlama: Lessons Learned From Teaching Llamas Dutch (2412.07633v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores strategies for adapting large language models (LLMs) to Dutch, a lower-resource language often underrepresented in LLM development. The authors collect a large dataset of Dutch text and apply continued pretraining and posttraining techniques to adapt the LLMs. Their results show that these techniques can effectively improve the LLMs' performance in Dutch, but may be more beneficial for lower-resource languages compared to ever-improving multilingual models. This work contributes to the development of Dutch LLMs and the understanding of adapting LLMs to lower-resource languages.</p>
