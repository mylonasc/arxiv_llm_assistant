<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13147v1>Are Your LLMs Capable of Stable Reasoning? (2412.13147v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper addresses the discrepancy between the impressive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks and their real-world applications. The authors introduce a new evaluation metric, G-Pass@k, which measures both the model's peak performance and its stability. They also present a dynamic benchmark, LiveMathBench, to minimize data leakage risks during evaluation. The results of their experiments highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods to improve LLMs' "realistic" reasoning capabilities. This work has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by providing a more comprehensive understanding of LLMs' capabilities and promoting the development of more effective evaluation methods.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13148v1>SWAN: Preprocessing SGD Enables Adam-Level Performance On LLM Training With Significant Memory Reduction (2412.13148v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents SWAN, a new stochastic optimizer that eliminates the need for additional moving average states in large language model training, resulting in significant memory reduction and improved computational efficiency. By pre-processing SGD with two simple operators, SWAN achieves Adam-level performance without the need for accumulative state variables. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by allowing for more scalable and efficient training of large language models.</p>

<p>
The paper presents a new framework, Compressed Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), which allows for efficient reasoning in language models through the use of compressed and continuous contemplation tokens. These tokens are generated from explicit reasoning chains and can be controlled to improve accuracy. This technique has the potential to significantly impact academic research by enabling additional reasoning capabilities in language models.</p>

<p>
The paper presents LMUnit, a new approach to evaluating language models using natural language unit tests. This method allows for more precise and interpretable assessment of model behavior, leading to improved inter-annotator agreement and more effective development workflows. LMUnit achieves state-of-the-art performance on evaluation benchmarks, indicating its potential to have a lasting impact on language model evaluation and development in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13013v1>The Emergence of Strategic Reasoning of Large Language Models (2412.13013v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to exhibit strategic reasoning abilities in complex environments. Through analyzing their performance in classical games, the study reveals that while LLMs show understanding of the games, they struggle with higher-order strategic reasoning. However, the findings also highlight the potential for LLMs, particularly OpenAI's GPT-o1, to advance and improve in this area, which could have a lasting impact on academic research in behavioral economics.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13180v1>Feather the Throttle: Revisiting Visual Token Pruning for Vision-Language Model Acceleration (2412.13180v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of using visual token pruning to accelerate Vision-Language Models. The authors find that while this approach may not excel at compressing visual information, it can still achieve strong performance on various tasks due to the limited ability of benchmarks to assess fine-grained visual capabilities. To address this issue, they propose a new approach called FEATHER, which shows significant performance improvement on localization benchmarks. This research has the potential to impact future studies on accelerating Vision-Language Models.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13169v1>Algorithmic Fidelity of Large Language Models in Generating Synthetic German Public Opinions: A Case Study (2412.13169v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to accurately replicate the socio-cultural context and nuanced opinions of human participants in the context of German public opinions. The study finds that LLMs, particularly Llama, have the ability to represent subpopulations and political biases, but the inclusion or exclusion of certain variables in the prompts can significantly impact the models' predictions. This highlights the potential for LLMs to have a lasting impact in academic research by providing a more robust and diverse representation of public opinions.</p>
