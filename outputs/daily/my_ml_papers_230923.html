<h1>Recent Breakthroughs in Machine Learning Research</h1>

<p>The field of machine learning is constantly evolving, with new developments and breakthroughs being made every day. From LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that enables the extension of pre-trained large language models' context sizes, to Boolformer, a Transformer architecture that can perform symbolic regression of Boolean functions, the potential for these advances to create a lasting impact in academic research is undeniable. This newsletter will present some of the most recent developments in machine learning research, and discuss their potential implications for the field.</p>

<p>LongLoRA is an efficient fine-tuning approach that enables the extension of pre-trained large language models' context sizes with limited computation cost. This approach has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research, as it can be implemented with only two lines of code in training, while being optional in inference, and is compatible with existing techniques. It also provides a dataset, LongQA, for supervised fine-tuning.</p>

<p>This paper presents a parallel algorithm that accelerates the training of non-linear sequential models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks and Neural Ord </div><div class="content">
