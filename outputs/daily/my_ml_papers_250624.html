The paper "LongRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Long-context LLMs" proposes a new framework that combines a "long retriever" and a "long reader" to improve performance in retrieval-augmented generation tasks. By increasing the unit size and reducing the total number of units, the burden on the retriever is lowered, resulting in significantly improved retrieval scores. The use of long-context LLMs also leads to impressive results in zero-shot answer extraction. This paper offers valuable insights for future research in combining RAG with long-context LLMs.</p>
