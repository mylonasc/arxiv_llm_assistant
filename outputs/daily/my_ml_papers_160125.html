<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08313v1>MiniMax-01: Scaling Foundation Models with Lightning Attention (2501.08313v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper introduces MiniMax-01, a series of models that use lightning attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) to efficiently scale to hundreds of billions of parameters. These models offer superior capabilities in processing longer contexts, with context windows of up to 4 million tokens during inference. Experiments show that MiniMax-01 matches the performance of top-tier models while offering 20-32 times longer context windows.
