<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02822v1>Language Understanding as a Constraint on Consensus Size in LLM Societies (2409.02822v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to reach consensus in collaborative tasks, similar to human societies. Through the application of complexity science and behavioral principles, the authors find that LLMs are capable of reaching consensus in groups, with the strength of this ability dependent on their language understanding capabilities. This has significant implications for the use of LLMs in academic research, as it suggests that these models could potentially surpass the cognitive limitations of human societies in reaching consensus.</p>
