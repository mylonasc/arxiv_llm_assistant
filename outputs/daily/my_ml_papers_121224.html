<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07585v1>Scaling Sequential Recommendation Models with Transformers (2412.07585v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for using transformer architecture in sequential recommendation models, which have shown good performance in various domains. The authors use the full Amazon Product Data dataset and reveal similar scaling behaviors to those found in language models. They also demonstrate the potential for downstream tasks by fine-tuning larger pre-trained models on smaller task-specific domains. This research provides valuable guidance for training and deploying models in high-dimensional preference spaces, potentially creating a lasting impact in academic research of sequential recommendation techniques.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07633v1>ChocoLlama: Lessons Learned From Teaching Llamas Dutch (2412.07633v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper explores strategies for adapting large language models (LLMs) to Dutch, a lower-resource language often underrepresented in LLM development. The authors collect a large amount of Dutch text and apply continued pretraining and posttraining techniques to improve the performance of the adapted models. The results show that these techniques can effectively scale for language adaptation, but may benefit more from focusing on language-specific posttraining rather than continued pretraining. This work contributes to the development of Dutch LLMs and the broader understanding of adapting LLMs to lower-resource languages.</p>
