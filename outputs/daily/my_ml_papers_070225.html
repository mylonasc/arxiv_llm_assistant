<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03460v1>Adapt-Pruner: Adaptive Structural Pruning for Efficient Small Language Model Training (2502.03460v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents Adapt-Pruner, a novel adaptive structural pruning technique for efficient training of small language models (SLMs). The results show that Adapt-Pruner outperforms conventional pruning methods and can even restore the performance of a MobileLLM-125M model to that of a 600M model with significantly fewer tokens. This technique has the potential to greatly impact the field of SLM research by providing a more efficient and effective approach for model training.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03373v1>Demystifying Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs (2502.03373v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential benefits of using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Through extensive experiments, the authors identify key factors that enable models to generate long CoT trajectories and provide practical guidance for optimizing training strategies. The findings suggest that with increased training compute and careful reward shaping, LLMs can effectively perform complex tasks such as STEM reasoning. These insights have the potential to significantly impact academic research in the use of LLMs for natural language processing tasks.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03327v1>Is In-Context Universality Enough? MLPs are Also Universal In-Context (2502.03327v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential reasons for the success of transformers in academic research, specifically their ability to perform in-context learning. The authors show that while transformers are universal in context, so are MLPs with trainable activation functions. This suggests that the success of transformers may be attributed to other factors such as inductive bias or training stability, rather than just in-context universality.</p>
