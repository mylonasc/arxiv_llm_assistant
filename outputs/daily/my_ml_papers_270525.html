<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18091v1>Data Mixing Can Induce Phase Transitions in Knowledge Acquisition (2505.18091v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the impact of data mixing on knowledge acquisition in Large Language Models (LLMs). Through experiments on a synthetic biography dataset, the authors demonstrate that the mixing ratio and model size can induce phase transitions, leading to sudden changes in the model's ability to memorize information. This highlights the importance of carefully considering data mixing strategies in LLM training, as the optimal approach may vary depending on the model size.</p>

<p>
This paper presents a new approach for low-rank optimization in training large language models, which reduces memory usage and computational costs. By using a two-step procedure that utilizes predefined orthogonal bases and adaptive selection of basis columns, the proposed method achieves similar performance to SVD-based methods while being more efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage. This technique has the potential to significantly impact academic research in the field of large language models.</p>

<p>
ManuSearch is a transparent and open multi-agent framework that aims to democratize deep search in large language models (LLMs). By decomposing the search and reasoning process into three collaborative agents, ManuSearch outperforms prior open-source baselines and even surpasses leading closed-source systems. This work has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by providing a reproducible and extensible platform for open deep search systems.</p>
