<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10972v1>Farseer: A Refined Scaling Law in Large Language Models (2506.10972v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
Farseer introduces a refined scaling law for Large Language Models (LLMs) that offers enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. This allows for reliable evaluation of training strategies and extrapolation of small-scale results to predict large-scale performance. The methodology also provides new insights into optimal compute allocation for LLM training. The open-sourcing of models, data, and results aims to foster further research in this area.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10885v1>Slimming Down LLMs Without Losing Their Minds (2506.10885v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient methods (LoRA and QLoRA) to improve performance in three key domains: commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and multi-domain knowledge. The results show that these methods can effectively enhance task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, with performance being influenced by the alignment between fine-tuning dataset and benchmark tasks. This study provides valuable insights and practical guidance for implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources, which could have a lasting impact on academic research in this field.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10911v1>NoLoCo: No-all-reduce Low Communication Training Method for Large Models (2506.10911v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new optimization method, NoLoCo, for training large language models that does not require expensive collective communication. This method has the potential to significantly reduce the cost and practical limitations of scaling up compute clusters for training large models. It also shows faster convergence rates compared to existing low communication methods, making it a promising technique for future academic research in this field.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10918v1>Sequential-Parallel Duality in Prefix Scannable Models (2506.10918v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the concept of "sequential-parallel duality" in modern neural sequence models, which allows for both efficient parallel training and fast sequential inference. The authors propose a new class of models, called Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs), that can achieve near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space sequential inference. These models have the potential to greatly impact academic research by unifying existing architectures and introducing new ones with improved efficiency and expressivity. Empirical evaluations on various tasks show promising results for PSMs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10848v1>Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models with SlowFast: The Three Golden Principles (2506.10848v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a novel dynamic sampling strategy, SlowFast Sampling, for diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) that alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages. The proposed method is guided by three principles and is integrated with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation. Experiments show significant speedups and outperformance of strong autoregressive baselines, highlighting the potential for lasting impact in academic research on dLLMs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967v1>Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs (2506.10967v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a novel visual token pruning method, CDPruner, for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that maximizes conditional diversity. This method outperforms current approaches by better representing input images while adhering to user instructions, resulting in strong performance even with high reduction ratios. The training-free and model-agnostic nature of CDPruner allows for easy application to various MLLMs, making it a potentially impactful technique in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10946v1>GUARD: Guided Unlearning and Retention via Data Attribution for Large Language Models (2506.10946v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents GUARD, a novel framework for Guided Unlearning and Retention via Data Attribution, which addresses the challenge of unintended forgetting in large language models (LLMs). By introducing a lightweight proxy data attribution metric and a novel unlearning objective, GUARD significantly enhances retention while maintaining comparable forgetting metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the potential for GUARD to substantially improve utility preservation in LLM unlearning, making a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<p>
The paper presents a new method, ReCUT, for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by balancing the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectories. This is achieved through a stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy, resulting in a significant reduction in reasoning lengths while maintaining or improving accuracy.
