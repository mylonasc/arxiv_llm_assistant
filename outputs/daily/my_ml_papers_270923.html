<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15088v1>RankVicuna: Zero-Shot Listwise Document Reranking with Open-Source Large Language Models (2309.15088v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
RankVicuna presents a fully open-source large language model (LLM) capable of performing listwise reranking in a zero-shot setting. Results on TREC 2019 and 2020 Deep Learning Tracks show that it can achieve effectiveness comparable to GPT-3.5 with a much smaller model, though slightly behind GPT-4. This work has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research, providing a reproducible and deterministic foundation for future research on reranking with modern LLMs.</p>

<p>
This paper presents Label Deconvolution (LD), a novel technique to alleviate learning bias in node representation learning on large-scale attributed graphs. LD approximates the inverse mapping of GNNs to incorporate GNNs in the training phase of NEs, and is shown to converge to the optimal objective function values by the joint training. Experiments demonstrate LD's potential to create a lasting impact in academic research of the described techniques.</p>

<p>
The Random Language Model (De Giuli 2019) suggests a single continuous transition to grammatical syntax, which is robust to explicit symmetry breaking. Comparison with human data suggests that the transition is equivalent to that experienced by children at age 24 months, potentially creating a lasting impact in academic research of language learning techniques.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15098v1>Attention Satisfies: A Constraint-Satisfaction Lens on Factual Errors of Language Models (2309.15098v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new approach to understanding the internal behavior of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) when generating factually incorrect text. By modeling factual queries as Constraint Satisfaction Problems, the authors discover a strong correlation between the model's attention to constraint tokens and the accuracy of its responses. The proposed SAT Probe method can predict constraint satisfaction and factual errors, and has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by enhancing the reliability of LLMs.</p>

This paper presents a novel value-guided decoding algorithm, PPO-MCTS, which combines Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate natural language text. Evaluation on four text generation tasks shows that PPO-MCTS significantly improves the quality of generated text compared to PPO alone. The potential for this technique to create a lasting impact in academic research is promising.</p>
