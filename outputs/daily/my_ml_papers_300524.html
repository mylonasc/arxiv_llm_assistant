<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18241v1>Active Use of Latent Constituency Representation in both Humans and Large Language Models (2405.18241v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for using latent constituency representation in both humans and large language models (LLMs) to better understand how sentences are internally represented. Through a one-shot learning task, the authors demonstrate that both humans and LLMs tend to delete a constituent, rather than a nonconstituent word string, indicating the emergence of a latent tree-structured constituency representation. This has the potential to greatly impact cognitive science and the development of LLMs.</p>
