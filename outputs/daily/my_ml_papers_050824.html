<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00620v1>Are Bigger Encoders Always Better in Vision Large Models? (2408.00620v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential impact of larger encoders in vision language models (VLMs) for understanding visual information. Through experiments on pretraining stages, the authors found that increasing encoder size does not always improve VLM performance. They also analyzed the effects of model size and data quality on pretraining outcomes and compared scaling laws between VLMs and other large language models. These findings have the potential to inform future research and development of VLMs in academic settings.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00584v1>Non Verbis, Sed Rebus: Large Language Models are Weak Solvers of Italian Rebuses (2408.00584v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the use of large language models in solving Italian rebuses, which are puzzles that require multi-step reasoning. While general-purpose systems struggle with this task, fine-tuning the models improves their performance. However, this improvement is largely due to memorization rather than linguistic proficiency. This highlights the need for further research and development in this area to fully utilize the potential of large language models in academic research.</p>
