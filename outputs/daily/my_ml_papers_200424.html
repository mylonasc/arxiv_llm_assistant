<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12224v1>Length Generalization of Causal Transformers without Position Encoding (2404.12224v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of NoPE, a Transformer-based language model without explicit position encodings, to generalize to longer sequences. By identifying a connection between attention distributions and NoPE's generalization failure, the authors propose a parameter-efficient tuning method that significantly expands its context size. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate competitive performance, suggesting the potential for NoPE to have a lasting impact in academic research on length generalization techniques.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12362v1>Transformer tricks: Removing weights for skipless transformers (2404.12362v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
He and Hofmann introduced a skipless transformer that removes V and P layers, reducing the number of weights. This technique is applicable to MHA but not MQA and GQA, commonly used in popular LLMs. The paper proposes mathematically equivalent versions for MQA and GQA, potentially reducing compute and memory complexity by 15%. This could have a lasting impact on academic research in transformer techniques.</p>
