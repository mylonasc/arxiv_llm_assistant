<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06126v1>Merging Feed-Forward Sublayers for Compressed Transformers (2501.06126v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a novel approach to model compression by merging similar parameter groups within a model, rather than pruning away less important parameters. The proposed technique is tested on various deep learning models and shows comparable performance to the original models while significantly reducing the number of parameters. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by allowing for the deployment of larger models on different hardware with memory constraints.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06025v1>How to Tune a Multilingual Encoder Model for Germanic Languages: A Study of PEFT, Full Fine-Tuning, and Language Adapters (2501.06025v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the use of multilingual encoder models for tasks in three Germanic languages. It compares full fine-tuning with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and finds that the latter is more effective for the higher-resource language, German. However, results for the other languages are less consistent. The study also evaluates the impact of adding PEFT modules trained on unstructured text, but finds no significant benefit. These findings have the potential to inform future research on optimizing multilingual encoder models for specific languages and tasks.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06098v1>ELFATT: Efficient Linear Fast Attention for Vision Transformers (2501.06098v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
ELFATT is a new efficient linear attention mechanism for vision tasks that offers significant speedups without sacrificing performance. It has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of long sequence tasks in academic research, with 4-7x speedups over traditional attention mechanisms and 1.6x to 2.0x speedups compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available for further research and development.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06003v1>Learning to generate feasible graphs using graph grammars (2501.06003v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a novel approach for generating feasible graphs using graph grammars, which can model complex dependencies and satisfy domain-specific constraints. This method overcomes the limitations of current generative methods based on message passing schemes, and has shown promising results in two domains: small drugs and RNA secondary structures. The implementation is publicly available, indicating potential for lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06117v1>Fleurs-SLU: A Massively Multilingual Benchmark for Spoken Language Understanding (2501.06117v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents Fleurs-SLU, a multilingual benchmark for spoken language understanding (SLU) that includes topical speech classification and multiple-choice question answering in over 90 languages. The authors demonstrate the potential for SLU to improve the robustness of multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and highlight the mutual benefits between acoustic and semantic speech representations. This benchmark has the potential to greatly impact academic research in the field of multilingual SLU and ASR, particularly for low-resource languages and inclusive speech technology.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06184v1>PEACE: Empowering Geologic Map Holistic Understanding with MLLMs (2501.06184v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents PEACE, a new agent designed for geologic map understanding, which utilizes Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to bridge the gap in current understanding. Through comprehensive experiments, PEACE significantly outperforms existing models and paves the way for advanced AI applications in geology, potentially enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of geological investigations. This has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research, particularly in fields such as disaster detection, resource exploration, and civil engineering.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06002v1>DeltaGNN: Graph Neural Network with Information Flow Control (2501.06002v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
DeltaGNN is a novel approach for detecting long-range and short-range interactions in graph-structured data using a mechanism called "information flow control". This method addresses challenges faced by traditional Graph Neural Networks, such as over-smoothing and over-squashing, with linear computational overhead. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve the expressiveness and scalability of GNNs, making them more effective for processing large and diverse graphs in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06101v1>From Conversation to Automation: Leveraging Large Language Models to Analyze Strategies in Problem Solving Therapy (2501.06101v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for large language models (LLMs) to automate the analysis of problem-solving therapy (PST) conversations. By leveraging LLMs, the study was able to identify and classify therapeutic interventions with high accuracy, and even introduce a new dimension of communication strategies.

<p>
This paper presents a technique for personalized language model learning on text data without user identifiers. By allowing each mobile device to maintain a user-specific distribution, the method breaks the one-to-one mapping between an embedding and a specific user, preventing the cloud from tracking users. Evaluation on public and industrial datasets shows significant improvements in accuracy while preserving real-time inference requirements. This approach has the potential to greatly impact academic research by providing personalized services without compromising data anonymization.</p>
