<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24200v1>Length-Induced Embedding Collapse in Transformer-based Models (2410.24200v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper addresses the issue of length-induced embedding collapse in transformer-based models, which leads to a decrease in performance on longer texts. By introducing a temperature parameter in the softmax function, the proposed method, TempScale, mitigates this limitation and improves performance on long text inputs. This has the potential to significantly impact academic research by improving the performance of text embedding models on longer texts, as demonstrated through empirical results on various datasets.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24177v1>DC-Spin: A Speaker-invariant Speech Tokenizer for Spoken Language Models (2410.24177v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents DC-Spin, a new technique for speech tokenization that aims to improve speech understanding and generation in spoken language models (SLMs). By extracting speaker-invariant tokens rich in phonetic information, DC-Spin enhances zero-shot SLM tasks and speech resynthesis. The proposed chunk-wise approach allows for streamable implementation without retraining and degradation. Comparisons with other tokenization methods and downstream task proxies show strong performance, highlighting the potential impact of DC-Spin in academic research on SLMs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24049v1>Desert Camels and Oil Sheikhs: Arab-Centric Red Teaming of Frontier LLMs (2410.24049v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper examines the biases of large language models (LLMs) against Arabs versus Westerners in various domains and evaluates their resistance to perpetuating these biases. The study finds that 79% of cases display negative biases towards Arabs, with LLMs being most biased in the LlaMA 3.1-405B model. Despite being an optimized version, GPT-4o is found to be the most vulnerable to biases and jailbreaks, highlighting the need for stronger bias mitigation strategies and security measures in LLMs.</p>
