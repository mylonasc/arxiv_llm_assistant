<h1>Unlocking the Potential of Machine Learning Research: Recent Developments</h1>

<p>Recent developments in machine learning research have the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research. From deploying large language models (LLMs) on CPUs with automatic INT4 weight-only quantization, to leveraging explicit morphological knowledge for pre-training of language models, to combining small language models with zero-shot and one-shot learning methods, the potential of machine learning research is vast. In this newsletter, we present recent developments in machine learning research that have the potential to revolutionize the field.</p>

<p>This paper presents an efficient approach to deploying large language models (LLMs) on CPUs, with automatic INT4 weight-only quantization and a special LLM runtime with highly-optimized kernels. This approach has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research, as it can enable LLMs to be deployed more efficiently and with improved inference efficiency.</p>

<p>This paper presents a new text rendering strategy for Pixel Language Models that can lead to improved performance on sentence-level tasks while maintaining performance on token-level and multilingual tasks. The proposed approach also reduces the number of parameters needed </div><div class="content">
