<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11746v1>Mixed Sparsity Training: Achieving 4$\times$ FLOP Reduction for Transformer Pretraining (2408.11746v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents Mixed Sparsity Training (MST), an efficient pretraining method for transformer-based large language models (LLMs). By integrating dynamic sparse training, sparsity variation, and hybrid sparse attention, MST can reduce FLOPs by 75% while maintaining performance. This has the potential to significantly decrease the computational demands of LLMs and make them more accessible for widespread adoption in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11656v1>Macformer: Transformer with Random Maclaurin Feature Attention (2408.11656v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
Macformer, a new Transformer architecture, utilizes random Maclaurin features (RMF) to approximate dot-product kernels, resulting in a linear time and space attention mechanism. This allows for efficient attention computations for long sequences. The proposed architecture also includes pre-post Scaling Batch Normalization (ppSBN) for regularization. Experiments show that Macformer is both efficient and accurate, making it a promising technique for improving academic research in the field of Transformers.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11815v1>Great Memory, Shallow Reasoning: Limits of $k$NN-LMs (2408.11815v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper explores the potential of $k$-nearest neighbor language models ($k$NN-LMs) to improve language modeling and downstream NLP tasks by integrating retrieval with next-word prediction. While these models have shown strong performance in memory-intensive tasks, they struggle with reasoning tasks that require integrating multiple pieces of information. The paper highlights the limitations of $k$NN-LMs in achieving high reasoning performance, even with perfect retrieval, and provides code and datastores for further research.</p>
