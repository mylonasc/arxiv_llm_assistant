<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02528v1>Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (2406.02528v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new approach to large language models (LLMs) that eliminates the need for matrix multiplication (MatMul) operations, resulting in significant memory and energy savings. The proposed MatMul-free models achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art Transformers at billion-parameter scales, and the performance gap decreases as the model size increases. The authors also provide a GPU-efficient implementation and a custom hardware solution on an FPGA, demonstrating the potential for future accelerators to optimize for lightweight LLMs.</p>
