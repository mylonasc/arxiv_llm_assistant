<p>
The paper explores the potential of using a small amount of textual long-form thought data to fine-tune multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and create a slow-thinking reasoning system, Virgo. The results show that this approach is effective and can even outperform visual reasoning data in eliciting the slow-thinking capacities of MLLMs. This finding has the potential to guide the development of more powerful slow-thinking reasoning systems, making a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<p>
The paper presents a new approach, VITA-1.5, for training multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to understand both visual and speech information. This method enables efficient speech-to-speech dialogue capabilities without separate ASR and TTS modules, significantly accelerating multimodal end-to-end response speed. By demonstrating its strong visual and speech capabilities, VITA-1.5 has the potential to greatly impact academic research in the field of multimodal dialogue systems.</p>

<p>
CachED (Gradient Caching for Encoder-Decoder models) enables end-to-end training of transformer-based models for long document summarization without truncation. By using non-overlapping sliding windows and gradient caching, it allows for processing of over 500K tokens during training and achieves superior performance without additional parameters. This technique has the potential to greatly impact academic research in long document summarization by addressing the challenge of quadratic memory consumption and improving model performance.</p>
