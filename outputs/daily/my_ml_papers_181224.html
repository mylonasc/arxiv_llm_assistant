<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11979v1>AlphaZero Neural Scaling and Zipf's Law: a Tale of Board Games and Power Laws (2412.11979v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the relationship between neural scaling laws and Zipf's law, a power law observed in natural language. Using AlphaZero, a reinforcement learning algorithm, the authors find that game states in training and inference data follow Zipf's law, and that agents optimize state loss in descending order of frequency. This has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by providing a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind neural scaling laws and their connection to Zipf's law.</p>

This paper explores the impact of token granularity on the predictive power of language model surprisal, a commonly used method for modeling human reading processes. The study finds that finer-grained tokens, defined by a larger vocabulary size, result in more accurate surprisal values for naturalistic text and garden-path constructions. This highlights the potential for token granularity to significantly improve the quality of language model surprisal in cognitive modeling research.</p>
