<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07074v1>Let's Ask GNN: Empowering Large Language Model for Graph In-Context Learning (2410.07074v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper introduces AskGNN, a novel approach that integrates graph data and task-specific information into large language models (LLMs) through In-Context Learning (ICL). By leveraging a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-powered retriever, AskGNN shows superior effectiveness in graph task performance across three tasks and seven LLMs. This technique has the potential to greatly impact academic research by enabling the use of LLMs for graph-structured data without extensive fine-tuning.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07173v1>Do better language models have crisper vision? (2410.07173v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the visual world and proposes a benchmark to evaluate their performance. The study suggests that decoder-based LLMs are better suited for representing text in vision-centric contexts, leading to the development of a new model called ShareLock. This model achieves impressive results with significantly less training time and resources, potentially revolutionizing the use of LLMs in computer vision research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07041v1>Emergent properties with repeated examples (2410.07041v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential benefits of using repeated examples in training deep learning models, specifically on three mathematical problems. The results show that models trained on smaller sets of repeated examples outperform those trained on larger sets of single-use examples. This suggests that the benefits of repetition may have a lasting impact on the interplay between generalization and memorization in deep learning, providing valuable insights for future research in this area.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07064v1>Data Selection via Optimal Control for Language Models (2410.07064v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a framework, PMP-based Data Selection (PDS), for selecting high-quality pre-training data from massive corpora to enhance the capabilities of language models (LMs) for downstream tasks. The theoretical results and experiments show that PDS-selected data can significantly improve LM training and performance, even for large models trained on vast amounts of data. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research in the field of language models.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07073v1>Pixtral 12B (2410.07073v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
Pixtral-12B is a new multimodal language model with 12 billion parameters that excels in understanding both natural images and documents. It outperforms larger models and does not compromise on natural language performance. This model also offers flexibility in processing images and can handle a large context window. Its release under an open-source license and the accompanying benchmark and evaluation protocols have the potential to greatly impact academic research in multimodal LLMs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07145v1>Stuffed Mamba: State Collapse and State Capacity of RNN-Based Long-Context Modeling (2410.07145v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to effectively handle long sequences during inference, which is a key advantage over transformer-based language models. The authors identify and address two practical concerns when applying RNNs to longer contexts, and propose three mitigation methods to improve their performance. Their findings suggest a promising future for RNN-based long-context modeling in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06981v1>Sparse Autoencoders Reveal Universal Feature Spaces Across Large Language Models (2410.06981v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the concept of feature universality in large language models (LLMs) and the challenges of comparing features across different models. The authors propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to transform LLM activations into more interpretable spaces and demonstrate significant similarities in SAE feature spaces across various LLMs. This has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by allowing discoveries about latent representations to generalize across multiple models.</p>
