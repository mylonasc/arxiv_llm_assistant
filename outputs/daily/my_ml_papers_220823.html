<h1>Unlocking the Potential of Machine Learning Research: Recent Developments</h1>

<p>The field of machine learning research is rapidly advancing, and recent developments have the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research. From context length extrapolation methods for large language models to a unified framework for benchmarking graph structure learning, the possibilities for machine learning research are seemingly endless. In this newsletter, we will explore the recent developments in machine learning research and discuss the potential breakthroughs that could come from them.</p>

<p>This paper presents a survey of context length extrapolation methods for large language models, and introduces a new truncation strategy for modifying the position encoding. Through evaluation tasks and perplexity, the authors find that linear scaling is the best method for extending context length, and that further gains can be achieved by using longer scales. The authors also release three new 13B parameter long-context models, Giraffe, and the code to replicate their results, which could have a lasting impact on academic research of LLMs.</p>

<p>This paper presents a sizeable manually annotated dataset of Bangla sentiment analysis and evaluates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero- and few-shot </div><div class="content">
