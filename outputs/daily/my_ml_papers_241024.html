<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17174v1>From Attention to Activation: Unravelling the Enigmas of Large Language Models (2410.17174v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a reformulation of the softmax function and a novel optimiser, OrthoAdam, to address two common issues in large language models: the dominance of the first token in attention heads and the occurrence of large outlier activations in hidden states. These techniques not only prevent these phenomena from occurring, but also enable the models to sustain their performance when quantised. This has the potential to greatly impact the use of large language models in academic research.</p>
