<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07143v1>Leave No Context Behind: Efficient Infinite Context Transformers with Infini-attention (2404.07143v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new method for efficiently scaling Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to infinitely long inputs. The proposed approach, called Infini-attention, incorporates a compressive memory and combines masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. This technique has the potential to greatly improve long-context language modeling and enable fast streaming inference for LLMs, making a lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<p>
The paper presents a new technique, called Graph Chain-of-Thought (Graph-CoT), for augmenting large language models (LLMs) with graphs to improve their performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. The authors manually construct a benchmark dataset, GRBench, and show that Graph-CoT outperforms existing methods consistently. This approach has the potential to significantly impact academic research by enabling LLMs to reason on interconnected texts and utilize the knowledge encoded in their connections.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07066v1>Exploring Concept Depth: How Large Language Models Acquire Knowledge at Different Layers? (2404.07066v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper investigates how large language models learn different concepts at different layers, with more complex concepts being acquired in deeper layers. By categorizing concepts based on their level of difficulty, the authors use a probing technique to extract representations from different layers and apply them to classification tasks. The results suggest that simpler concepts are learned in shallower layers, while more complex ones may require deeper layers. This has implications for understanding model learning processes and internal representations.</p>

<p>
This paper presents an empirical study on the groundedness of long-form question answering using retrieval-augmented large language models. The results show that a significant portion of generated sentences are ungrounded, even when they contain correct answers. This highlights the need for more robust mechanisms in LLMs to improve the groundedness of generated content, which could have a lasting impact on the use of these techniques in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07123v1>Semantically-correlated memories in a dense associative model (2404.07123v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new associative memory model, CDAM, which combines auto- and hetero-association in a unified framework. It uses a graph structure to link memory patterns and has been shown to have four distinct dynamical modes. The use of anti-Hebbian learning rules allows for control of hetero-association and the ability to extract multi-scale representations of community structures. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of CDAM in handling real-world data and replicating neuroscience experiments.</p>
