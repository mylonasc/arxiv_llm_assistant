<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01367v1>Transformers are Universal In-context Learners (2408.01367v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of transformers, a type of deep architecture, to handle an unlimited number of context tokens. By mathematically analyzing the expressivity and smoothness of these architectures, the authors demonstrate that transformers are universal and can accurately approximate continuous in-context mappings. This has significant implications for academic research, as it allows for a single transformer to operate on an infinite number of tokens with fixed dimensions and number of heads.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01423v1>Prompt Recursive Search: A Living Framework with Adaptive Growth in LLM Auto-Prompting (2408.01423v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a novel framework, Prompt Recursive Search (PRS), that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate tailored solutions for specific problems, conserving tokens and reducing the likelihood of errors. Through extensive experiments, the PRS method has shown significant improvements in accuracy compared to the traditional method of manually crafting prompts. This framework has the potential to greatly impact academic research in the field of Natural Language Processing by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs in addressing a diverse array of tasks.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01262v1>RAGEval: Scenario Specific RAG Evaluation Dataset Generation Framework (2408.01262v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents RAGEval, a framework for automatically generating evaluation datasets to assess the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in dealing with data from different vertical domains. This addresses a gap in existing RAG benchmarks, which mainly focus on general knowledge. The proposed framework has the potential to better evaluate the knowledge usage ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and avoid confusion in existing QA datasets. This could have a lasting impact on academic research in the field of RAG systems.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01417v1>Talk Less, Interact Better: Evaluating In-context Conversational Adaptation in Multimodal LLMs (2408.01417v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper explores whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can adapt and increase communication efficiency during interactions, similar to how humans do. The authors introduce an automated framework, ICCA, to evaluate this conversational adaptation in MLLMs. They find that while MLLMs can understand efficient language, they do not spontaneously make their own language more efficient over time. This highlights the need for further research and development in training regimes for MLLMs to achieve this common hallmark of human language.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01308v1>Reconsidering Token Embeddings with the Definitions for Pre-trained Language Models (2408.01308v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper discusses the potential for improving token embeddings in natural language processing through the use of definitions from Wiktionary. By constructing isotropically distributed and semantics-related embeddings, the proposed method, DefinitionEMB, has shown to enhance the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as RoBERTa-base and BART-large. This has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by improving the effectiveness of PLMs in various tasks, including text summarization.</p>
