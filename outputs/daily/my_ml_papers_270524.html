<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14852v1>PV-Tuning: Beyond Straight-Through Estimation for Extreme LLM Compression (2405.14852v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents PV-Tuning, a representation-agnostic framework for fine-tuning compressed parameters in large language models (LLMs). It questions the use of straight-through estimators (STE) for extreme LLM compression and shows that PV-Tuning outperforms prior techniques for highly-performant models such as Llama and Mistral. This has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy-vs-bit-width trade-off in academic research on extreme LLM compression.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14755v1>Large language models can be zero-shot anomaly detectors for time series? (2405.14755v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for large language models (LLMs) to be used as zero-shot anomaly detectors for time series data. The authors present a framework, sigllm, which includes a time-series-to-text conversion module and end-to-end pipelines for LLMs to perform anomaly detection. They compare two paradigms for testing LLMs' abilities and find that while LLMs can detect anomalies, deep learning models still outperform them. This research has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by expanding the capabilities of LLMs and their applications in various fields.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14860v1>Not All Language Model Features Are Linear (2405.14860v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper challenges the linear representation hypothesis in language models and explores the potential for multi-dimensional features. By developing a rigorous definition and using sparse autoencoders, the authors discover interpretable multi-dimensional features in GPT-2 and Mistral 7B, such as circular features representing days of the week and months of the year. These findings have the potential to significantly impact the understanding and application of language models in academic research.</p>
