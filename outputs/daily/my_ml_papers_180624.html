<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10149v1>BABILong: Testing the Limits of LLMs with Long Context Reasoning-in-a-Haystack (2406.10149v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper "BABILong: Testing the Limits of LLMs with Long Context Reasoning-in-a-Haystack" introduces a new benchmark, BABILong, designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to reason across long contexts. The benchmark includes 20 challenging reasoning tasks and shows that popular LLMs only utilize a small portion of the context and their performance declines with increased complexity. This benchmark has the potential to drive the development of new models with increased capabilities in handling long contexts, leading to lasting impact in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10057v1>First Multi-Dimensional Evaluation of Flowchart Comprehension for Multimodal Large Language Models (2406.10057v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a comprehensive method, FlowCE, for evaluating the abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in tasks related to flowcharts. This method covers various dimensions such as reasoning, localization recognition, information extraction, logical verification, and summarization. However, even the highest scoring model, Phi-3-Vision, only achieved a score of 49.97, indicating the potential for further research and development in this area. The open-sourcing of this project on GitHub can contribute to the advancement of MLLMs in flowchart-related tasks.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10209v1>Be like a Goldfish, Don't Memorize! Mitigating Memorization in Generative LLMs (2406.10209v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a technique called the "goldfish loss" to mitigate the issue of memorization in large language models. By excluding a randomly sampled subset of tokens from the training objective, the model is prevented from verbatim reproduction of the training data. This technique has the potential to significantly reduce extractable memorization without impacting downstream benchmarks, making it a valuable tool for improving the privacy and copyright risks associated with large language models in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10181v1>Practical offloading for fine-tuning LLM on commodity GPU via learned subspace projectors (2406.10181v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new offloading framework, LSP_Offload, that allows for efficient and fast fine-tuning of large language models on commodity GPUs. By using learned subspace projectors and a novel communication schedule, the framework can achieve near-native speed and significantly increase fine-tuning throughput compared to existing offloading methods. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by enabling faster and more efficient fine-tuning of large language models on affordable hardware.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10229v1>Quantifying Variance in Evaluation Benchmarks (2406.10229v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper highlights the importance of quantifying variance in evaluation benchmarks for large language models (LLMs). It discusses various metrics for measuring variance and provides empirical estimates for different models. The study suggests that simple changes can reduce variance for smaller scale models, while more complex methods may not be as effective. This work encourages practitioners to consider variance when comparing models.</p>
