<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09636v1>Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference (2403.09636v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a method called Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC) for compressing key-value caches in large language models (LLMs) during inference, leading to significant improvements in throughput. DMC is applied to pre-trained LLMs and can achieve up to 3.7x increase in auto-regressive inference on a GPU. The results show that DMC can preserve the original performance while significantly reducing the memory requirements, making it a promising technique for improving the efficiency of LLMs in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09599v1>Logical Discrete Graphical Models Must Supplement Large Language Models for Information Synthesis (2403.09599v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper argues that while large language models have advanced information retrieval, they have limitations in terms of general intelligence and information synthesis. The authors propose using logical discrete graphical models to supplement these language models, as they can address issues such as hallucinations, complex reasoning, and planning under uncertainty. This approach has the potential to greatly enhance academic research in information retrieval and natural language processing.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09635v1>Transformers Get Stable: An End-to-End Signal Propagation Theory for Language Models (2403.09635v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new signal propagation theory for transformer models, which can help mitigate common issues such as vanishing/exploding gradients and instability. The proposed DeepScaleLM technique allows for the training of very deep models with improved performance in various tasks, indicating potential for long-lasting impact in academic research on transformer models.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09539v1>Logits of API-Protected LLMs Leak Proprietary Information (2403.09539v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper highlights the potential for significant information leakage from API-protected large language models (LLMs). By exploiting a softmax bottleneck in the model architecture, the authors demonstrate the ability to extract proprietary information with relatively few API queries. This has implications for the commercialization of LLMs and suggests the need for increased transparency and security measures.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09611v1>MM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training (2403.09611v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a study on the design and data choices for building high-performing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Through extensive experimentation, the authors identify key design lessons, such as the importance of a careful mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data for achieving state-of-the-art results. By scaling up their approach, they introduce MM1, a family of multimodal models with up to 30B parameters that show promising potential for enhancing in-context learning and multi-image reasoning in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09572v1>Eyes Closed, Safety On: Protecting Multimodal LLMs via Image-to-Text Transformation (2403.09572v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a novel approach, ECSO, for protecting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) from jailbreak attacks. By adaptively transforming unsafe images into texts, ECSO activates the intrinsic safety mechanism of pre-aligned LLMs in MLLMs, resulting in significantly improved model safety without compromising utility. This technique has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by providing a training-free solution for protecting MLLMs and generating supervised-finetuning data without human intervention.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09606v1>Large Language Models and Causal Inference in Collaboration: A Comprehensive Survey (2403.09606v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper discusses the potential impact of using causal inference in collaboration with Large Language Models (LLMs) in academic research. The authors highlight the benefits of this approach, such as improved predictive accuracy, fairness, and explainability in NLP models. They also explore how LLMs can contribute to the field of causal inference, creating a mutually beneficial relationship between the two. This has the potential to advance the development of more advanced and equitable artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09613v1>Reawakening knowledge: Anticipatory recovery from catastrophic interference via structured training (2403.09613v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper discusses the potential benefits of using structured training for neural networks in academic research. The authors found that in a non-IID setting, where documents are presented in a fixed sequence, networks can exhibit anticipatory behavior and recover from catastrophic interference. This behavior becomes more robust as the network's architecture scales up, providing new insights into training over-parameterized networks in structured environments.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09559v1>Less is More: Data Value Estimation for Visual Instruction Tuning (2403.09559v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new data selection approach, TIVE, for visual instruction tuning in multimodal large language models. Through empirical studies, the authors reveal a significant redundancy within visual instruction datasets and show that greatly reducing the amount of data does not affect performance. TIVE estimates the value of visual instructions and selects representative instances for training, achieving comparable performance with only 7.5% of the data. This approach has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of visual instruction tuning in academic research.</p>
