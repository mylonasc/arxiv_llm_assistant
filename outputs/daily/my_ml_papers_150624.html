<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09334v1>ProxyLM: Predicting Language Model Performance on Multilingual Tasks via Proxy Models (2406.09334v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
ProxyLM is a framework that uses proxy models to predict the performance of multilingual language models on specific natural language processing tasks. This approach significantly reduces computational costs and allows for efficient deployment and iterative improvements of language models. It also outperforms traditional methods and showcases adaptability to new languages. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by streamlining model selection and reducing the need for extensive computational resources.</p>

<p>
The paper presents a new technique, Multi-Layer Key-Value (MLKV) sharing, for reducing memory usage in transformer models during auto-regressive inference. This approach extends Key-Value (KV) caching across transformer layers and has been shown to significantly reduce memory usage with minimal performance loss. This has the potential to greatly benefit academic research by enabling more efficient deployment of transformer models at scale.</p>

<p>
The paper presents a framework for curating multiview datasets and fine-tuning Large Language Vision Models (LLVMs) for Activities of Daily Living (ADL). The resulting LLVM, LLAVIDAL, incorporates 3D poses and object trajectories to better understand the spatiotemporal relationships within ADLs. The proposed benchmark, ADLMCQ, quantifies the effectiveness of LLVMs in ADL scenarios. LLAVIDAL consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong temporal reasoning capabilities.
