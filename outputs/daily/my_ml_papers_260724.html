<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18158v1>Unlocking Tokens as Data Points for Generalization Bounds on Larger Language Models (2407.18158v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new approach for deriving generalization bounds for large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. By utilizing properties of martingales and considering the vast number of tokens in LLM training sets, the proposed technique achieves non-vacuous bounds for LLMs as large as LLaMA2-70B. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research by providing more accurate and practical generalization bounds for LLMs.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18129v1>Dallah: A Dialect-Aware Multimodal Large Language Model for Arabic (2407.18129v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
Dallah is a new Arabic multimodal assistant that utilizes an advanced language model to improve interactions between users and technology. By fine-tuning six Arabic dialects, Dallah demonstrates its ability to handle complex dialectal interactions and outperforms other models in benchmark tests. This has the potential to pave the way for further development of dialect-aware Arabic MLLMs and make significant contributions to academic research in this area.</p>

<p>
This paper explores the potential of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for stock return prediction using financial newsflow. The study compares different LLMs and their text representation methods, finding that aggregated representations from LLMs' token-level embeddings can enhance portfolio performance. Mistral, among the three LLMs studied, shows the most consistent results. This research has the potential to significantly impact quantitative investing and portfolio optimization in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18119v1>Tracking linguistic information in transformer-based sentence embeddings through targeted sparsification (2407.18119v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for targeted sparsification to track linguistic information in transformer-based sentence embeddings. By analyzing the relationship between linguistic information and internal architecture and parameters, the authors demonstrate that this information is not distributed throughout the entire embedding, but rather localized in specific regions. This understanding can have a lasting impact on the development of explainable neural models in academic research.</p>
