<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17396v1>Systematic Reasoning About Relational Domains With Graph Neural Networks (2407.17396v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for reasoning in relational domains. Previous work has shown that GNNs struggle with longer inference chains, limiting their reasoning abilities. The authors propose a new GNN architecture that treats node embeddings as epistemic states, allowing for systematic generalization. This approach achieves state-of-the-art results and outperforms neuro-symbolic methods on a benchmark that requires evidence aggregation from multiple relational paths. This has the potential to greatly impact academic research in the field of reasoning and could lead to more efficient and accurate models.</p>
