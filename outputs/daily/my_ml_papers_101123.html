<p>
LLaVA-Plus is a general-purpose multimodal assistant that can use pre-trained vision and vision-language models to fulfill real-world tasks. It has been trained on multimodal instruction-following data to acquire the ability to use tools, and has been shown to outperform existing models. Its potential to create a lasting impact in academic research lies in its ability to directly ground image queries and actively engage throughout the entire human-AI interaction session.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05590v1>Conversational AI Threads for Visualizing Multidimensional Datasets (2311.05590v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to create and refine visualizations through conversational interfaces. Through a Wizard-of-Oz study and crowdsourced study, the authors found that LLMs can be used to support visual analysis, but need to be improved to support progressive refinements. The authors developed AI Threads, a multi-threaded analytic chatbot, to address this issue and demonstrated its potential with a dataset outside the LLM's training corpus. This research has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by providing a new way to visualize multidimensional datasets.</p>
