<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11968v1>Efficacy of Synthetic Data as a Benchmark (2409.11968v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of using synthetic data generated by large language models (LLMs) as a benchmark for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The authors conduct experiments on six datasets and find that while synthetic data can effectively capture performance for simpler tasks, it falls short for more complex tasks. They also propose a new metric to evaluate biases introduced by using the same LLM for both generating data and performing tasks. This research highlights the importance of considering the task and using multiple larger models when using synthetic data as a benchmark in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12147v1>MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for Reasoning (2409.12147v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents MAgICoRe, a multi-agent, iterative, coarse-to-fine refinement technique for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs). MAgICoRe addresses key challenges in refinement, such as excessive refinement, inability to localize and address errors, and insufficient refinement. It uses a multi-agent loop with three agents and incorporates external step-wise reward model scores to improve error localization. Evaluation on LLMs shows MAgICoRe's effectiveness in improving performance and its potential to continue improving with more iterations.</p>
