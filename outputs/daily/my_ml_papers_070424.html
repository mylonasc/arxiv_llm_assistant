<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03626v1>Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text (2404.03626v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper proposes a novel compression technique, Equal-Info Windows, for training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. This method shows potential for improving training and serving efficiency, as well as reducing latency. While it may not achieve the same perplexity as subword tokenizers, it offers shorter sequence lengths which can lead to faster inference speed. Further improvements and analysis are suggested for the use of high-compression tokenizers in academic research.</p>
