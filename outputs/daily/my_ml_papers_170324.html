<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09636v1>Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference (2403.09636v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a method called Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC) for compressing key-value caches in large language models (LLMs) during inference. By retrofitting pre-trained LLMs with DMC, the authors achieve significant improvements in throughput without sacrificing downstream performance. This technique has the potential to greatly enhance the efficiency of LLMs and make them more practical for use in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09599v1>Logical Discrete Graphical Models Must Supplement Large Language Models for Information Synthesis (2403.09599v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper argues that while large language models have advanced information retrieval, they have limitations in terms of general intelligence and information synthesis. The authors propose using logical discrete graphical models to supplement these language models, as they can address issues such as hallucinations, complex reasoning, and planning under uncertainty. This approach has the potential to greatly enhance academic research in information retrieval and natural language processing.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09539v1>Logits of API-Protected LLMs Leak Proprietary Information (2403.09539v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper highlights the potential for significant information leakage from API-protected large language models (LLMs). By exploiting a softmax bottleneck in the models, the authors demonstrate the ability to extract proprietary information with relatively few API queries. This has implications for the commercialization of LLMs and the need for increased transparency and security measures. The presented techniques have the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by shedding light on the vulnerabilities of LLMs and the importance of protecting sensitive information.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09611v1>MM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training (2403.09611v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a study on building high-performing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through careful analysis of architecture components and data choices. The results show that a mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art few-shot results. The presented recipe has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by enabling enhanced in-context learning and multi-image reasoning in large-scale pre-training.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09572v1>Eyes Closed, Safety On: Protecting Multimodal LLMs via Image-to-Text Transformation (2403.09572v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a novel approach, ECSO, for protecting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) from jailbreak attacks. By adaptively transforming unsafe images into texts, ECSO enhances model safety significantly while maintaining utility results on common MLLM benchmarks. It also has the potential to generate supervised-finetuning data for MLLM alignment without extra human intervention, making it a valuable tool for academic research in this field.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09613v1>Reawakening knowledge: Anticipatory recovery from catastrophic interference via structured training (2403.09613v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper discusses the potential benefits of using structured training in neural networks to overcome catastrophic interference. The authors found that this approach can lead to anticipatory behavior, allowing the network to recover from forgetting previous information before encountering it again. This behavior becomes more robust as the network's architecture scales up, providing new insights into training over-parameterized networks in structured environments. These findings have the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research on neural network training techniques.</p>

The paper "Less is More: Data Value Estimation for Visual Instruction Tuning" explores the potential for reducing the amount of data used in visual instruction tuning for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Through empirical studies, the authors reveal significant data redundancy and propose a new data selection approach, TIVE, which can achieve comparable performance with only 7.5% of the data. This has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of MLLMs in vision scenarios, making a lasting impact in academic research.</p>
