<h1>Unlocking the Potential of Machine Learning Research: Recent Developments</h1>

<p>Recent developments in machine learning research have the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research. From exploring the impact of sparsity on the scaling behavior of Transformers to converting MLP-and-attention transformers into attention-only transformers, researchers are pushing the boundaries of what is possible with machine learning. Additionally, techniques such as replacing the softmax attention mechanism in vision transformers with ReLU, creating a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating the performance of language models in Traditional Chinese, and introducing a novel framework that combines the powerful language processing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the efficient optimization performance of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are all potential breakthroughs. </p>

<p>In addition, researchers are exploring the impacts of external knowledge on large language models (LLMs) when it conflicts with their parametric knowledge, as well as the ability of multilingual language models to reason with proverbs and sayings in a conversational context. These findings suggest that even indirect integration of external knowledge can lead to LLM hallucination, and that mLLMs struggle to reason with figurative proverbs and </div><div class="content">
<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08520v1>Scaling Laws for Sparsely-Connected Foundation Models (2309.08520v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the impact of sparsity on the scaling behavior of Transformers trained on large datasets. It identifies a scaling law that describes the relationship between sparsity, number of non-zero parameters, and amount of training data.

<p>
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of LM-based query and document expansion techniques, showing that they can improve generalization in information retrieval, but only in specific settings. The results suggest that expansions should be used with weaker models or when the target dataset differs from the training corpus, otherwise they can introduce false positives and reduce performance.</p>

This paper explores the impacts of external knowledge on large language models (LLMs) when it conflicts with their parametric knowledge. A framework is proposed to systematically elicit LLM parametric knowledge and introduce external knowledge, revealing that LLMs tend to produce responses that deviate from their parametric knowledge when faced with direct conflicts or confounding changes. The findings suggest that even indirect integration of external knowledge can lead to LLM hallucination, with potential lasting impacts on academic research.</p>
