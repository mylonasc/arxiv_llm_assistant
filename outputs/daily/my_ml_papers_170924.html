<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08864v1>Exploring Graph Structure Comprehension Ability of Multimodal Large Language Models: Case Studies (2409.08864v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential impact of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) on graph comprehension. By incorporating visual representations, these advanced models offer improvements in understanding graphs. The study compares the effectiveness of multimodal approaches against purely textual representations, providing valuable insights into the potential and limitations of leveraging visual modalities to enhance LLMs' graph comprehension abilities.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08937v1>Emerging Reliance Behaviors in Human-AI Text Generation: Hallucinations, Data Quality Assessment, and Cognitive Forcing Functions (2409.08937v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the impact of hallucinations and cognitive forcing functions in human-AI collaborative text generation tasks, specifically in the context of conversational customer support. Through an inquiry involving 11 users, the study found that the presence of hallucinations negatively affects data quality. However, the use of cognitive forcing functions can mitigate this impact and influence how users rely on AI-generated responses. These findings have the potential to significantly impact the use of Large Language Models in academic research and improve the quality of AI-generated content in conversational AI contexts.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08813v1>Your Weak LLM is Secretly a Strong Teacher for Alignment (2409.08813v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential of using a weak large language model (LLM) as a more efficient and scalable approach for alignment in ensuring LLMs act in accordance with human values and intentions. The study shows that weak LLMs can provide feedback that rivals or exceeds that of fully human-annotated data, indicating a promising middle ground for alignment strategies. This has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by offering a more sustainable and cost-effective approach to alignment.</p>
