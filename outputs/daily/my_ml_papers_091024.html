<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229v1>GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models (2410.05229v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper "GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models" addresses the growing interest in the formal reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in mathematics. The authors introduce a new benchmark, GSM-Symbolic, to evaluate the mathematical reasoning of LLMs and find that their performance is highly variable and deteriorates as the complexity of the question increases. This work provides important insights into the limitations of LLMs in mathematical reasoning and highlights the need for more nuanced evaluations in this area.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05192v1>Understanding Warmup-Stable-Decay Learning Rates: A River Valley Loss Landscape Perspective (2410.05192v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate schedule allows for indefinite training of language models without a pre-specified compute budget. This is achieved by using a constant learning rate for the main branch and a rapidly decaying rate for branching out. The WSD schedule is based on the concept of a river valley loss landscape, which explains the non-traditional loss curve observed. This technique has the potential to greatly impact academic research in language model training, as it allows for efficient and effective training with varying compute budgets.</p>
