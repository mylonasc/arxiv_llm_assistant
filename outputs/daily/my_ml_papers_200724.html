<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13623v1>Scaling Laws with Vocabulary: Larger Models Deserve Larger Vocabularies (2407.13623v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the impact of vocabulary size on the scaling of large language models (LLMs). Through various approaches, the authors demonstrate that larger models require larger vocabularies for optimal performance. They also show that many current LLMs are using vocabulary sizes that are too small, and increasing the vocabulary size can significantly improve downstream performance. This highlights the importance of considering both model parameters and vocabulary size for efficient scaling in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13657v1>FuLG: 150B Romanian Corpus for Language Model Pretraining (2407.13657v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper introduces FuLG, a large Romanian corpus for language model pretraining, extracted from CommonCrawl. This corpus is significantly larger than existing Romanian corpora and can potentially have a lasting impact on academic research in the field of language models. The authors also present their methodology for filtering FuLG and compare it to other Romanian corpora through ablation studies.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13578v1>Large Language Models as Reliable Knowledge Bases? (2407.13578v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as reliable knowledge bases (KBs) in academic research. While previous studies suggest that LLMs can encode knowledge, this study defines criteria for evaluating their effectiveness as KBs, including factuality and consistency. Results show that even high-performing LLMs are not reliable KBs, highlighting the need for further exploration and improvement in this area.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13744v1>LLMs as Function Approximators: Terminology, Taxonomy, and Questions for Evaluation (2407.13744v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper discusses the evolution of Natural Language Processing techniques from task-specific models to more general pre-trained models. It argues that the lack of clarity on what these models actually model has led to unhelpful metaphors and proposes a new approach of seeing their value in approximating specialist functions based on natural language specifications. This approach raises important questions about the quality, discoverability, stability, and protectability of these functions, bringing together various aspects of evaluation and highlighting the need for further research in this area.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13565v1>dzFinNlp at AraFinNLP: Improving Intent Detection in Financial Conversational Agents (2407.13565v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents the dzFinNlp team's contribution to improving intent detection in financial conversational agents. They experimented with various models and features, including traditional machine learning and deep learning methods, as well as transformer-based models. Their results show promising potential for these techniques to have a lasting impact on academic research in this field.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13696v1>Benchmark Agreement Testing Done Right: A Guide for LLM Benchmark Evaluation (2407.13696v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper discusses the importance of Benchmark Agreement Testing (BAT) in assessing the validity of benchmarks for Language Models (LMs). It highlights the lack of standardized procedures for BAT and how this can lead to invalid conclusions and mistrust in benchmarks. The authors propose a set of best practices for BAT and introduce a python package and meta-benchmark to facilitate future research. This has the potential to greatly improve the robustness and validity of benchmark evaluations in the evolving landscape of language model research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13647v1>Weak-to-Strong Reasoning (2407.13647v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper introduces a progressive learning framework that allows a strong language model to autonomously improve its reasoning capabilities without relying on a more advanced model or human-annotated data. The method is tested on multiple datasets and shows significant improvements in reasoning abilities. This approach has the potential to greatly enhance AI reasoning powers and pave the way for more sophisticated strategies in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13709v1>Understanding Reference Policies in Direct Preference Optimization (2407.13709v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the impact of reference policies on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a popular training method for large language models. The authors investigate the optimal strength of the KL-divergence constraint in DPO, the necessity of reference policies for instruction fine-tuning, and the potential benefits of stronger reference policies. Their findings provide insights for best practices and identify open research questions for future studies, highlighting the lasting impact of DPO in academic research.</p>

<p>
This paper presents a study on the effectiveness of using Sentence Transformers compared to TF-IDF features for detecting writers' stances on important topics such as COVID-19 vaccine, digital transformation, and women empowerment. The results show that Sentence Transformers outperform TF-IDF features and have the potential to improve stance detection models for addressing societal issues. This has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research on stance detection.</p>
