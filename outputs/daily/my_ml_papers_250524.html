<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14852v1>PV-Tuning: Beyond Straight-Through Estimation for Extreme LLM Compression (2405.14852v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new framework, PV-Tuning, for fine-tuning compressed parameters in large language models (LLMs) that outperforms existing techniques. It questions the use of straight-through estimators (STE) for extreme LLM compression and provides convergence guarantees in restricted cases. PV-Tuning has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy-vs-bit-width trade-off for highly-performant LLMs, making it a valuable tool for future research in this area.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14755v1>Large language models can be zero-shot anomaly detectors for time series? (2405.14755v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the potential for large language models (LLMs) to be used as zero-shot anomaly detectors for time series data. The authors introduce a framework, sigllm, which includes a time-series-to-text conversion module and end-to-end pipelines for LLMs to perform anomaly detection. Results show that while LLMs are capable of detecting anomalies, they are still outperformed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. However, the flexible nature of LLMs presents a promising avenue for future research in this area.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14860v1>Not All Language Model Features Are Linear (2405.14860v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper challenges the linear representation hypothesis in language models and explores the potential for multi-dimensional features. By developing a rigorous definition and using sparse autoencoders, the authors discover interpretable features in GPT-2 and Mistral 7B, such as circular features representing days of the week and months of the year. These findings have the potential to impact future research in language models and computational problem-solving.</p>
