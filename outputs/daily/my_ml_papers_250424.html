<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15146v1>Rethinking LLM Memorization through the Lens of Adversarial Compression (2404.15146v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper proposes a new metric, Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR), for assessing memorization in large language models (LLMs). This metric offers an adversarial view to measuring memorization and allows for flexibility in measuring it for arbitrary strings. This could have a lasting impact in academic research as it provides a practical tool for monitoring unlearning and compliance, and potentially serves as a legal tool for addressing data usage violations.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15228v1>Re-Thinking Inverse Graphics With Large Language Models (2404.15228v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to solve inverse graphics problems, which involve understanding the physical elements of an image. By leveraging the broad world knowledge encoded in LLMs, the proposed Inverse-Graphics Large Language Model (IG-LLM) framework shows promise in facilitating precise spatial reasoning about images without the need for image-space supervision. This has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by opening up new possibilities for solving inverse graphics challenges.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15149v1>Bias patterns in the application of LLMs for clinical decision support: A comprehensive study (2404.15149v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a comprehensive study on the potential bias patterns in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for clinical decision support. The study evaluates eight popular LLMs across three question-answering datasets using standardized clinical vignettes. The results reveal significant disparities across protected groups and highlight the impact of prompt design on bias patterns. The study calls for further evaluation and enhancement of LLMs in clinical decision support applications.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15276v1>SMPLer: Taming Transformers for Monocular 3D Human Shape and Pose Estimation (2404.15276v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents SMPLer, a new framework for monocular 3D human shape and pose estimation that addresses the issue of quadratic computation and memory complexity in existing Transformer models. By incorporating decoupled attention and an SMPL-based target representation, as well as introducing novel modules, SMPLer effectively utilizes high-resolution features and outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. This has the potential to greatly impact the accuracy and efficiency of 3D human shape and pose estimation in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15045v1>Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts (2404.15045v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts (MH-MoE), a technique that addresses two issues with Sparse Mixtures of Experts (SMoE) - low expert activation and lacking fine-grained analytical capabilities. MH-MoE uses a multi-head mechanism to split tokens into sub-tokens, which are processed by a diverse set of experts and then reintegrated. This approach improves expert activation, deepens context understanding, and alleviates overfitting. The straightforward implementation and compatibility with other SMoE models make MH-MoE a promising technique for enhancing performance in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15052v1>Finite Automata for Efficient Graph Recognition (2404.15052v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents a new approach to graph recognition using finite automata, building upon previous work on linear graph grammars. By lifting automata from strings to graphs, the authors demonstrate the potential for efficient recognition of graph languages, without the need for backtracking. This technique has the potential to greatly impact academic research in graph theory and formal language theory.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15238v1>CultureBank: An Online Community-Driven Knowledge Base Towards Culturally Aware Language Technologies (2404.15238v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents CultureBank, an online community-driven knowledge base that aims to enhance language models' cultural awareness. By utilizing a generalizable pipeline, the authors construct a diverse and contextualized knowledge base from user-generated content on TikTok and Reddit. The results show improved performance of language models on cultural tasks, highlighting the potential for CultureBank to have a lasting impact on the development of culturally aware language technologies in academic research. </p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15103v1>Multi-view Content-aware Indexing for Long Document Retrieval (2404.15103v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new technique, Multi-view Content-aware indexing (MC-indexing), for more effective long document question answering (DocQA). This technique addresses the limitations of existing indexing methods by segmenting documents into content chunks and representing them in multiple views. The results show a significant increase in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods, making MC-indexing a promising approach for improving the performance of retrievers in long DocQA.</p>
