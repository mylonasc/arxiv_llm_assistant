<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919v1>LISA: Layerwise Importance Sampling for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Fine-Tuning (2403.17919v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new technique, Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) that addresses the issue of high memory consumption. LISA utilizes importance sampling and freezing of middle layers during optimization, resulting in improved performance compared to existing techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Experimental results show that LISA outperforms LoRA and full parameter training in various settings, making it a promising alternative for efficient LLM fine-tuning. This technique has the potential to significantly impact academic research in the field of machine learning and natural language processing.</p>
