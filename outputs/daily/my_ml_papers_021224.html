So let's dive in and discover the potential of these cutting-edge techniques!</p> </div><div class="content">
<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18553v1>Retrofitting (Large) Language Models with Dynamic Tokenization (2411.18553v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper proposes retrofitting language models with dynamic tokenization, which allows for the dynamic determination of token boundaries based on input text. This technique has the potential to greatly improve efficiency and capabilities in languages other than English, as well as enable the use of LMs in new domains and languages. It also promotes fairness across languages and has the potential to overcome the limitations of static tokenization, making LMs more equitable and adaptable.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18571v1>Challenges in Adapting Multilingual LLMs to Low-Resource Languages using LoRA PEFT Tuning (2411.18571v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the challenges of adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to low-resource languages and investigates the potential benefits of using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) on multilingual Gemma models for Marathi. The findings suggest that while evaluation metrics may show a decline in performance, manual assessments indicate improved language generation capabilities. This highlights the potential for these techniques to have a lasting impact on academic research in low-resource language settings.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18506v1>LLM-ABBA: Understand time series via symbolic approximation (2411.18506v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a method, LLM-ABBA, that integrates adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) into large language models (LLMs) for time series tasks. By utilizing a symbolic time series representation, LLM-ABBA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in classification and regression tasks. The use of existing tokens in LLMs and a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA also contribute to its success. This framework has the potential to make a lasting impact in time series research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18620v1>Cross-modal Information Flow in Multimodal Large Language Models (2411.18620v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper explores the inner workings of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and how they combine visual and linguistic information for tasks such as visual question answering. Through experiments, the authors identify two distinct stages in the integration process and provide a new perspective on how MLLMs process and combine different modalities. This research has the potential to greatly impact future studies on multimodal information localization and editing.</p>
