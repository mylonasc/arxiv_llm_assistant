<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24200v1>Length-Induced Embedding Collapse in Transformer-based Models (2410.24200v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper addresses the issue of length-induced embedding collapse in transformer-based models, which leads to a decrease in performance on longer texts. By introducing a temperature parameter in the softmax function, the proposed method, TempScale, mitigates this limitation and improves performance on long text inputs. This has the potential to significantly impact academic research in the field of text embeddings and downstream tasks.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24177v1>DC-Spin: A Speaker-invariant Speech Tokenizer for Spoken Language Models (2410.24177v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents DC-Spin, a new technique for speech tokenization in spoken language models (SLMs). By extracting speaker-invariant tokens rich in phonetic information, DC-Spin enhances zero-shot SLM tasks and speech resynthesis. The proposed chunk-wise approach allows for streamable DC-Spin without retraining and degradation. Comparisons with other tokenization methods and downstream task proxies show strong performance, providing insights for designing speech tokenizers for SLMs. This technique has the potential to significantly impact and improve speech processing in academic research.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24049v1>Desert Camels and Oil Sheikhs: Arab-Centric Red Teaming of Frontier LLMs (2410.24049v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper examines the biases of large language models (LLMs) against Arabs and Westerners in various domains and their vulnerability to perpetuating these biases. The study finds that most LLMs display negative biases towards Arabs and are susceptible to "jailbreaks" that exaggerate negative traits. These findings highlight the need for stronger bias mitigation strategies and security measures in LLMs to ensure their lasting impact in academic research.</p>
