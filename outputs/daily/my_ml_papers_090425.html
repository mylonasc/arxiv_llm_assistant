<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06214v1>From 128K to 4M: Efficient Training of Ultra-Long Context Large Language Models (2504.06214v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper presents an efficient training method for building ultra-long context large language models (LLMs) with context lengths of up to 4M tokens. The approach leverages continued pretraining and instruction tuning to maintain instruction-following and reasoning abilities. The resulting model, UltraLong-8B, achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-context benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks. This approach has the potential to significantly impact academic research by enabling models to process and reason over longer sequences of text and multimodal data.</p>

<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06036v1>Multi-Sense Embeddings for Language Models and Knowledge Distillation (2504.06036v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
This paper introduces multi-sense embeddings as a way to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) by capturing the different meanings of words and tokens. The authors also propose a knowledge distillation method that uses these sense embeddings to create a smaller student model that can mimic the senses of the larger LLM, resulting in significant space and time savings without sacrificing performance. The potential for these techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of LLMs could have a lasting impact on academic research in natural language processing.</p>
