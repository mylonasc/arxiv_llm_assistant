<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12981v1>Reducing Transformer Key-Value Cache Size with Cross-Layer Attention (2405.12981v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new technique, Cross-Layer Attention (CLA), for reducing the size of key-value (KV) cache in transformer-based autoregressive large language models (LLMs). This technique builds upon the existing Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) methods and allows for a 2x reduction in KV cache size while maintaining high accuracy. This has the potential to significantly improve the memory/accuracy tradeoffs in training and inference of large language models, enabling longer sequence lengths and larger batch sizes.</p>
