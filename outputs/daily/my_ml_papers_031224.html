<p>
This paper explores the impact of individual tokens on the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). It identifies the existence of "critical tokens" that can lead to incorrect reasoning trajectories and proposes a novel approach, cDPO, to automatically recognize and conduct token-level rewards for these critical tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in improving the performance of LLMs on reasoning tasks. This technique has the potential to create a lasting impact in academic research by enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and improving their overall performance.</p>
