<h4><a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09695v1>LoRAP: Transformer Sub-Layers Deserve Differentiated Structured Compression for Large Language Models (2404.09695v1)</a> </h4>
<p>
The paper presents a new approach, LoRAP, for compressing large language models (LLMs) by taking advantage of the low-rank structure in the multi-head self-attention (MHA) sub-layer of the Transformer architecture. This approach combines Low-Rank matrix approximation and structured pruning, and also takes into account the varying degrees of low-rank structure in different weight matrices. The proposed method outperforms previous compression techniques in terms of zero-shot perplexity and task classification, showing potential for lasting impact in LLM research.</p>
